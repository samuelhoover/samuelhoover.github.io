I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in [Chemical Engineering at UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering), studying the phase behavior of complex polymer systems in the [Muthukumar Group](http://theory.pse.umass.edu/). My work focuses on using conventional and modern modeling techniques to understand the fundamental physics underlying polymer aggregates and biomolecular condensates.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-hoover) and on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/samuelhoover)!
