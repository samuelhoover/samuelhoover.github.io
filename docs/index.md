## About Me
---
I am a third year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering">chemical engineering at UMass Amherst</a>, studying the phase behavior of complex polymer systems in the <a href="http://theory.pse.umass.edu/">Muthukumar Group</a>. My work focuses on using conventional and modern modeling techniques to understand the fundamental physics underlying polymer aggregates.

You can find my ongoing and completed projects using the link in the sidebar.
