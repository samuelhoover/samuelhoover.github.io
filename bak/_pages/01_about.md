I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering">chemical engineering at UMass Amherst</a>, studying the phase behavior of complex polymer systems in the <a href="http://theory.pse.umass.edu/">Muthukumar Group</a>. My work focuses on using conventional and modern modeling techniques to understand the fundamental physics underlying polymer aggregates and biomolecular condensates.
