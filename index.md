## About Me
---
I am a PPG Fellow and fourth year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering">chemical engineering at UMass Amherst</a> studying the phase behavior of complex polymer systems in the <a href="http://theory.pse.umass.edu/">Muthukumar Group</a>. My work focuses on using conventional and modern modeling techniques to understand the fundamental physics underlying polymer aggregates in synthetic and biological systems. I am actively looking for full-time positions with an expected start date of Summer 2024.

You can find my ongoing and completed projects using the link in the sidebar.
