## About Me

---

Programmer by choice, chemical engineer by compulsion ([I'm joking, I'm joking!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1GRckaQ_s)).

**I am actively looking for full-time positions with an expected start date of Summer 2024.**

I am a PPG Fellow and fourth year Ph.D. candidate in [Chemical Engineering at UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/academics/departments/chemical-engineering) studying the phase behavior of complex polymer systems in the [Muthukumar Group](http://theory.pse.umass.edu/). My work focuses on using theory, simulation, and machine learning techniques to understand the fundamental physics underlying polymer aggregates in synthetic and biological systems.

Outside of the lab, my hobbies include cooking and baking (especially when it's for my girlfriend), learning computer science, reading post WWII-era history, and hanging out with my cats [Leo (demon)](/assets/imgs/leo.png) and [Lou Lou (angel)](/assets/imgs/loulou.png) whom I both *love* equally.

You can find my ongoing and completed projects using the link in the sidebar.
