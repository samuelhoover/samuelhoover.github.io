## Selected projects

### ZeoNet

Using convolutional neural networks on volumetric data to predict adsorption properties in nanoporous materials. Published in *Journal of Materials Chemisty A*. Main contributions come from Yachan Liu and Gustavo Perez. I contributed to the earlier stages of this project, developing the pipelines and learning framework and finding that simple geometric descriptors cannot reliably predict adsorption properties.
