  abstract = {Nanopore DNA sequencing is a method in which DNA bases are determined (base- called) using electric current signals generated by passing DNA through nanopore sensors. The raw measured signals can be aggregated into event data presenting new bases entering the nanopore. This thesis has two contributions. First, we implemented RNN-based single- and double-strand basecallers for simulated event data to analyze the effect of signal noise. As the SNR decreased from 20 dB to 5 dB, the accuracy of the single-strand basecaller dropped 9\% while the accuracy of double-strand basecaller only dropped 0.5\%. Second, we implemented an end-to- end single-strand basecaller, directly processing the raw signal using an encoder- decoder model with attention instead of the CTC-style approach used in available basecallers. We achieved an accuracy of 81.9\% for a viral sample and an accuracy of 90.9\% for a bacterial sample. Our accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art basecallers with a considerably smaller model.},

  abstract = {We present a minimal model to study the effects of pH on liquid phase separation of macromolecules. Our model describes a mixture composed of water and macromolecules that exist in three different charge states and have a tendency to phase separate. This phase separation is affected by pH via a set of chemical reactions describing protonation and deprotonation of macromolecules, as well as self-ionization of water. We consider the simple case in which interactions are captured by Flory-Huggins interaction parameters corresponding to Debye screening lengths shorter than a nanometer, which is relevant to proteins inside biological cells under physiological conditions. We identify the conjugate thermodynamic variables at chemical equilibrium and discuss the effective free energy at fixed pH. First, we study phase diagrams as a function of macromolecule concentration and temperature at the isoelectric point of the macromolecules. We find a rich variety of phase diagram topologies, including multiple critical points, triple points, and first-order transition points. Second, we change the pH relative to the isoelectric point of the macromolecules and study how phase diagrams depend on pH. We find that these phase diagrams as a function of pH strongly depend on whether oppositely charged macromolecules or neutral macromolecules have a stronger tendency to phase separate. One key finding is that we predict the existence of a reentrant behavior as a function of pH. In addition, our model predicts that the region of phase separation is typically broader at the isoelectric point. This model could account for both in~vitro phase separation of proteins as a function of pH and protein phase separation in yeast cells for pH values close to the isoelectric point of many cytosolic proteins.},

  abstract = {The dielectric constant of ionic solutions is known to reduce with increasing ionic concentrations. However, the origin of this effect has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we study two such possible sources: long-range Coulombic correlations and solvent excluded-volume. Correlations originate from fluctuations of the electrostatic potential beyond the mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory, evaluated by employing a field-theoretical loop expansion of the free energy. The solvent excluded-volume, on the other hand, stems from the finite ion size, accounted for via a lattice-gas model. We show that both correlations and excluded volume are required in order to capture the important features of the dielectric behavior. For highly polar solvents, such as water, the dielectric constant is given by the product of the solvent volume fraction and a concentration-dependent susceptibility per volume fraction. The available solvent volume decreases as a function of ionic strength due the increasing volume fraction of ions. A similar decrease occurs for the susceptibility due to the correlations between the ions and solvent, reducing the dielectric response even further. Our predictions for the dielectric constant fit well with experiments for a wide range of concentrations for different salts in different temperatures, using a single fit parameter related to the ion size.},

The results show that the temperature dependence of the solvent dielectric constant and solvent{\textendash}polymer interaction parameter can result in a complex phase behavior involving two disjoint unstable regions on the temperature (T){\textendash}polyelectrolyte concentration ({$\phi$}p) plane. Comparison of phase diagrams constructed for different possible temperature dependencies of {$\epsilon$} and {$\chi$} shows that the experimentally observed LCST behavior is obtained only if the solvent dielectric constant decreases and the solvent{\textendash}polymer interaction parameter increases with increasing temperature. Preferential partitioning of salt into the polyelectrolyte poor phase is predicted for all possible combinations of temperature dependencies of {$\chi$} and {$\epsilon$} considered in this work.},

  abstract = {Polymeric systems exhibit interesting macroscopic properties under different thermodynamic conditions and are prevalent in both biology and synthetic world. How a system of polymers behaves under different thermodynamic conditions is determined by the interplay of different possible interactions such as short-ranged Van der Waals and long-ranged electrostatic interactions and the entropy of individual components present in the system. This work is mostly focused on the theoretical study of the thermodynamic phase behaviors of charged polymers in solutions. We use the methods of both analytical theory and numerical computations in order to find the free energies and then the thermodynamically most stable states of systems under consideration. Our topics of interest in this work include phase separation of solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (also known as complex coacervation), interfacial tension in polyelectrolyte complex coacervates, orientations of rigid polyelectrolytes in solutions and the statistics of amorphous chains in polymer semi-crystals. We develop a new free energy expression to study the phase behaviors of polyelectrolyte complex coacervates, complementing numerous existing theories and construct phase diagrams to predict the effect of experimental variables in the phase behavior. We explore in detail on both the upper critical solution (UCST) and the lower critical solution (LCST) behavior and compare the theoretical predictions with experiments. The constructed phase diagrams predict that salt and asymmetry in polycation-polyanion content suppress complex coacervation. We also show that a solution can exhibit UCST or LCST depending upon the temperature dependencies of the solvent\{polymer interaction parameter and the solvent dielectric constant. These predictions are in qualitative agreements with experiments. Further, by using this new free energy, we numerically compute the interfacial tension between the interface of a polyelectrolyte complex coacervate phase and a coexisting aqueous dilute phase. We predict that the interfacial tension decreases with increasing the salt concentration and it increases with increasing the polyelectrolyte chain length. Next, we study the thermodynamics of charged rods in solution, focusing on the effect of electrostatic interactions among the rods in determining their relative orientations. We show that electrostatic repulsion among the rods tends to stabilize the solution against the isotropic-nematic phase transition/separation. Finally, we study the statistics of ties and loops in the amorphous regions of polymer crystals. Here the focus is on determining the fraction of ties, it is because of their relevance in determining the mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers. We calculate the fraction of ties and loops by calculating the partition sum of the amorphous region by using the field-theoretic techniques in statistical mechanics. We show that the fraction of ties increases with increasing the chain length and it decreases with increasing the thickness of the amorphous region.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {There is a lot of research interest in encoding variable length sentences into fixed length vectors, in a way that preserves the sentence meanings. Two common methods include representations based on averaging word vectors, and representations based on the hidden states of recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs. The sentence vectors are used as features for subsequent machine learning tasks or for pre-training in the context of deep learning. However, not much is known about the properties that are encoded in these sentence representations and about the language information they capture. We propose a framework that facilitates better understanding of the encoded representations. We define prediction tasks around isolated aspects of sentence structure (namely sentence length, word content, and word order), and score representations by the ability to train a classifier to solve each prediction task when using the representation as input. We demonstrate the potential contribution of the approach by analyzing different sentence representation mechanisms. The analysis sheds light on the relative strengths of different sentence embedding methods with respect to these low level prediction tasks, and on the effect of the encoded vector's dimensionality on the resulting representations.},

Here, we demonstrate that the polypeptide fragments can instead be detected and classified at the single-molecule limit using a nanometer-scale pore formed by the protein aerolysin. Specifically, three different water-soluble proteins treated with the same protease, trypsin, produce different polypeptide fragments defined by the degree by which the latter reduce the nanopore's ionic current. The fragments identified with the aerolysin nanopore are consistent with the predicted fragments that trypsin could produce.},

  abstract = {Most proteins fold into 3D structures that determine how they function and orchestrate the biological processes of the cell. Recent developments in computational methods have led to protein structure predictions that have reached the accuracy of experimentally determined models. While this has been independently verified, the implementation of these methods across structural biology applications remains to be tested. Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modelling of interactions; and modelling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25\% additional residues can be confidently modelled when compared to homology modelling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the PDB. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and protein complexes surpass state-of-the-art tools and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared to experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered. In summary, we find that these advances are likely to have a transformative impact in structural biology and broader life science research.},

We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. Flamingo models include key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Flamingo models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video understanding benchmarks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer, captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event, and close-ended tasks such as multiple choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, we demonstrate that a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art for few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On many of these benchmarks, Flamingo actually surpasses the performance of models that are fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.},

  abstract = {Synthetic polymers are versatile and widely used materials. Similar to small organic molecules, a large chemical space of such materials is hypothetically accessible. Computational property prediction and virtual screening can accelerate polymer design by prioritizing candidates expected to have favorable properties. However, in contrast to organic molecules, polymers are often not well-defined single structures but an ensemble of similar molecules, which poses unique challenges to traditional chemical representations and machine learning approaches. Here, we introduce a graph representation of molecular ensembles and an associated graph neural network architecture that is tailored to polymer property prediction. We demonstrate that this approach captures critical features of polymeric materials, like chain architecture, monomer stoichiometry, and degree of polymerization, and achieves superior accuracy to off-the-shelf cheminformatics methodologies. While doing so, we built a dataset of simulated electron affinity and ionization potential values for {$>$}40k polymers with varying monomer composition, stoichiometry, and chain architecture, which may be used in the development of other tailored machine learning approaches. The dataset and machine learning models presented in this work pave the path toward new classes of algorithms for polymer informatics and, more broadly, introduce a framework for the modeling of molecular ensembles.},

  abstract = {In molecular discovery and drug design, structure{\textendash}property relationships and activity landscapes are often qualitatively or quantitatively analyzed to guide the navigation of chemical space. The roughness (or smoothness) of these molecular property landscapes is one of their most studied geometric attributes, as it can characterize the presence of activity cliffs, with rougher landscapes generally expected to pose tougher optimization challenges. Here, we introduce a general, quantitative measure for describing the roughness of molecular property landscapes. The proposed roughness index (ROGI) is loosely inspired by the concept of fractal dimension and strongly correlates with the out-of-sample error achieved by machine learning models on numerous regression tasks.},

The polymer-rich phase exhibits less hydration with increasing temperature, while an increase in Cs increases the hydration extent. The apparent critical temperature, taken as the minimum in the phase diagram, occurs only for a narrow range of Cs.

Our data-driven approach predicts the stability of natural and de novo designed proteins, and the quantitative function of molecularly diverse mutants, competitively with the state-of-the-art methods.

Despite its short timespan, the synergetic application of deep learning to inverse molecular design has outpaced decades of theoretical efforts, bearing promise to transform current molecular design paradigms. Herein, we provide an overview of the element of computational inverse molecular design and offer our views on current limitations and outstanding challenges. In our perspective, three main directions are identified for each element and analyzed in terms of their merits and relevant novel deep learning developments. For the molecular representations element, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), grids, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are discussed for enhancing the expressivity, complexity, descriptivity of relevant molecular information, respectively. Second, chemical text mining, accelerated quantum chemical calculations, and transfer learning are explored to augment the size and the accuracy of current property data and predictive models. Last, emerging trends in design methods including generative modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning (AL) are examined for optimizing not only computational costs, but also experimental and simulation efforts. The presented discussions are aimed at catalyzing progress and interdisciplinary collaborations toward general-purpose inverse design frameworks.},

  abstract = {Studies of genome regulation routinely use high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches to determine where specific proteins interact with DNA, and they rely on DNA amplification and short-read sequencing, limiting their quantitative application in complex genomic regions. To address these limitations, we developed directed methylation with long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq), which uses antibody-tethered enzymes to methylate DNA near a target protein's binding sites in situ. These exogenous methylation marks are then detected simultaneously with endogenous CpG methylation on unamplified DNA using long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies. We optimized and benchmarked DiMeLo-seq by mapping chromatin-binding proteins and histone modifications across the human genome. Furthermore, we identified where centromere protein A localizes within highly repetitive regions that were unmappable with short sequencing reads, and we estimated the density of centromere protein A molecules along single chromatin fibers. DiMeLo-seq is a versatile method that provides multimodal, genome-wide information for investigating protein{\textendash}DNA interactions.},

At mesoscopic length scales, nucleosomes pack in a manner that serves to regulate gene expression through condensation and expansion of the genome. The particular structures that arise and their respective thermodynamic stabilities, however, have yet to be fully resolved. In this study, we combine molecular modeling using the 1CPN mesoscale model of chromatin with nonlinear manifold learning to identify and characterize the structure and free energy of metastable states of short chromatin segments comprising between 4- and 16-nucleosomes. Our results reveal the formation of two previously characterized tetranucleosomal conformations, the "{$\alpha$}-tetrahedron"and the "{$\beta$}-rhombus", which have been suggested to play an important role in the accessibility of DNA and, respectively, induce local chromatin compaction or elongation. The spontaneous formation of these motifs is potentially responsible for the slow nucleosome dynamics observed in experimental studies. Increases of the nucleosome repeat length are accompanied by more pronounced structural irregularity and flexibility and, ultimately, a dynamic liquid-like behavior that allows for frequent structural reorganization. Our findings indicate that tetranucleosome motifs are intrinsically stable structural states, driven by local internucleosomal interactions, and support a mechanistic picture of chromatin packing, dynamics, and accessibility that is strongly influenced by emergent local mesoscale structure.},

Molecular-level studies of coacervation have been limited. In this work, a coarse-grained model of the polymers and the corresponding counterions is proposed and used to simulate coacervation as a function of polymer length and overall salt concentration. Several sampling methods are used to determine the phase behavior of the underlying polymers. In particular, the results of simulations in different ensembles are shown to be consistent and to reproduce a number of phenomena observed in experiments, including the disruption of complexation by increasing ionic strength or by decreasing molecular weight. The coacervate concentrations determined from phase behavior calculations are then used to examine the rheology of the corresponding materials. By relying on long dynamic simulations, we are able to generate the dynamic response of the material in the form of dynamic moduli as a function of frequency, which are also found to compare favorably with experimental measurements.},

Specifically, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymers, as well as how to optimally develop polymer descriptors without requiring human-based feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems by utilizing a periodic polymer graph representation that accounts for polymers' periodicity and coupling it with a message-passing neural network that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically relevant polymer descriptors. Remarkably, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 10 distinct polymer property prediction tasks. These results highlight the advancement in predictive capability that is possible through learning descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.},

Self-consistent field theory is a powerful tool to predict such phase-separated structures, and phase diagrams of block copolymers have been reported using self-consistent field theory. However, obtaining stable morphology of each polymer structure and the {$\chi$} parameter requires intensive computational study. We applied deep learning to predict phase diagrams from metastable structures obtained by crude, cost-effective self-consistent field calculation. We used a 3D convolutional neural network for classification of the metastable structures, and a limited number of sets of block copolymer structures and {$\chi$} parameters with stable phase labels were used for training. After the model was trained using the training set, it successfully assigned the metastable structures of a wide variety of diblock and triblock copolymers to the correct stable phases. This approach is capable of predicting the phase diagrams of block copolymers effectively without intensive self-consistent field calculation.},

However, the successful use of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for designing new materials relies on the correct chemistry- and temperature-dependent Flory{\textendash}Huggins interaction parameter {$\chi$}AB that quantifies the incompatibility between the two blocks A and B as well as accurate estimation of the ratio of Kuhn lengths (bA/bB) and block densities. This work uses machine learning to model the phase behavior of AB diblock copolymers by using the chemical identities of blocks directly, obviating the need for measurement of {$\chi$}AB and bA/bB. The random forest approach employed predicts the phase behavior with almost 90\% accuracy after training on a data set of 4768 data points, almost twice the accuracy obtained using SCFT employing {$\chi$}AB from group contribution theory. The machine-learning model is notably sensitive toward the uncertainty in measuring molecular parameters; however, its accuracy still remains at least 60\% even for highly uncertain experimental measurements. Accuracy is substantially reduced when extrapolating to chemistries outside the training set. This work demonstrates that a random forest phase predictor performs remarkably well in many scenarios, providing an opportunity to predict self-assembly without measurement of molecular parameters.},

  abstract = {New long read sequencing technologies offer huge potential for effective recovery of complete, closed genomes. While much progress has been made on cultured isolates, the ability of these methods to recover genomes of member taxa in complex microbial communities is less clear. Here we examine the ability of long read data to recover genomes from enrichment reactor metagenomes. Such modified communities offer a moderate level of complexity compared to the source communities and so are realistic, yet tractable, systems to use for this problem. We sampled an enrichment bioreactor designed to target anaerobic ammonium-oxidising bacteria (AnAOB) and sequenced genomic DNA using both short read (Illumina 301bp PE) and long read data (MinION Mk1B) from the same extraction aliquot. The community contained 23 members, of which 16 had genome bins defined from an assembly of the short read data. Two distinct AnAOB species from genus             Candidatus             Brocadia were present and had complete genomes, of which one was the most abundant member species in the community. We can recover a 4Mb genome, in 2 contigs, of long read assembled sequence that is unambiguously associated with the most abundant AnAOB member genome. We conclude that obtaining near closed, complete genomes of members of low-medium microbial communities using MinION long read sequence is feasible.},

Here, we demonstrate that charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly compartmentalizing biomolecules. Formation and dissolution of these liquid bodies was controlled by changes in peptide phosphorylation state using a kinase/phosphatase enzyme pair. The droplet-generating phase transition responded to modification of even a single serine residue. Electrostatic interactions between the short cationic peptides and the much longer polyanionic RNAs drove phase separation. Coacervates were also formed on silica beads, a primitive model for localization at specific intracellular sites. This work supports phosphoregulation of complex coacervation as a viable mechanism for dynamic intracellular compartmentalization in membraneless organelles.},

PORE-cupine also captures global structural features, such as RNA-binding-protein binding sites and reactivity differences at single-nucleotide variants. We show that shared sequences in different transcript isoforms of the same gene can fold into different structures, highlighting the importance of long-read sequencing for obtaining phase information. We also demonstrate that structural differences between transcript isoforms of the same gene lead to differences in translation efficiency. By revealing isoform-specific RNA structure, PORE-cupine will deepen understanding of the role of structures in controlling gene regulation.

  abstract = {This thesis describes a novel approach to the fabrication and characterisation of metal- lic nanopores and their application for the detection of single DNA molecules. Metallic nanopores with apparent diameters below 20 nm are produced using electrochemical de- position and real-time ionic current feedback. Beginning with large nanopores (diameter 100-200 nm) milled into gold silicon nitride membranes using a focused ion beam, platinum metal is electrodeposited onto the gold surface, thus reducing the effective pore diame- ter. By simultaneously observing the ion current feedback, the shrinking of the nanopore can be monitored and terminated at any pre-defined value of the pore conductance in a precisely controlled and reproducible way. The ion transport properties of the metallic nanopore system are investigated by char- acterising the pore conductance at varying potentials across the nanopore and concentra- tions of electrolyte. The results are compared to conventional bare silicon nitride nanopore systems. Chemical modification at the nanopore surface is also studied using thiolisation to reduce the capacitive charging effects observed with metallic nanopores. Further to this, impedance measurements are carried out to study the resistive behaviour exhibited in these systems. An equivalent circuit model is proposed to validate the results obtained from the experimental studies. To evaluate the suitability of these nanopores for applications in single-molecule biosens- ing, translocation experiments using {$\lambda$}-DNA are performed. DNA molecules are electroki- netically driven through the nanopore under an applied electric field, hence as the DNA translocates through the pore, current blockade events are detected. Each event is the result of a single molecular interaction of DNA with the nanopore and is characterised by its dwell time and amplitude. Characterisation studies and noise analysis towards the applicability of metallic nanopores as single molecule detectors are also studied and compared to current bare silicon nitride pore systems.},

A number of models have been proposed for this task, many of which achieved very high accuracies of around 97-99\%. In this work, we study how systematic the generalization of such models is, that is to which extent they are capable of handling novel combinations of known linguistic constructs. To this end, we test models' understanding of referring expressions based on matching object properties (such as e.g. "another cube that is the same size as the brown cube") in novel contexts. Our experiments on the thereby constructed CLOSURE benchmark show that state-of-the-art models often do not exhibit systematicity after being trained on CLEVR. Surprisingly, we find that an explicitly compositional Neural Module Network model also generalizes badly on CLOSURE, even when it has access to the ground-truth programs at test time. We improve the NMN's systematic generalization by developing a novel Vector-NMN module architecture with vector-valued inputs and outputs. Lastly, we investigate how much few-shot transfer learning can help models that are pretrained on CLEVR to adapt to CLOSURE. Our few-shot learning experiments contrast the adaptation behavior of the models with intermediate discrete programs with that of the end-to-end continuous models.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We compare both types of models in how much they lend themselves to a particular form of systematic generalization. Using a synthetic VQA test, we evaluate which models are capable of reasoning about all possible object pairs after training on only a small subset of them. Our findings show that the generalization of modular models is much more systematic and that it is highly sensitive to the module layout, i.e. to how exactly the modules are connected. We furthermore investigate if modular models that generalize well could be made more end-to-end by learning their layout and parametrization. We find that end-to-end methods from prior work often learn inappropriate layouts or parametriza-tions that do not facilitate systematic generalization. Our results suggest that, in addition to modularity, systematic generalization in language understanding may require explicit regularizers or priors.},

The problem relates to quickly bringing a double-stranded polymer well above its melting temperature, i.e., the binding interactions between the strands are neglected, and the strands separate from each other as it is entropically favorable for them to do so. The strands unwind by rotating around each other until they separate. We find that the process proceeds from the ends inward; intermediate conformations can be characterized by a tightly wound inner part, from which loose strands are sticking out, with length  {$\mathsl{l}\sim$} {$\mathsl{t}$} 0.39 l{$\sim$}t0.39 . The total time needed for the two strands to unwind scales as a power of  {$\mathsl{N}$} N  as  {$\mathsl{T}$} {$\mathsl{u}$} {$\sim$} {$\mathsl{N}$} 2.57{$\pm$}0.03 {$\tau$}u{$\sim$}N2.57{$\pm$}0.03 .

  abstract = {Presently, proteins are identified by cleaving them with proteases, measuring the mass to charge ratio of the fragments with a mass spectrometer, and matching the fragments to segments within known proteins in databases. We earlier demonstrated that a nanometer-scale pore formed by aerolysin (AeL) can discriminate between, and therefore identify, three similar size proteins from their trypsin-cleaved polypeptide fragments. With this nanopore-protease method, the protein's identity is instead determined from characteristic ionic current blockade patterns caused by the polypeptide fragments that enter the nanopore. The results also suggested that not all of the theoretically expected cleavage products partition into the pore. To better understand the mechanism by which polypeptide fragments are captured, and how different polypeptides reduce the pore's ionic current, we studied the effects of 11 identical length polypeptides with different net charges and charge distributions. We show that under certain experimental conditions, negative, positive, and neutral polypeptides are driven into the AeL pore by the same applied voltage polarity. The capture rate and dwell time of polypeptides in the pore depend strongly on the ionic strength, the magnitude of the applied voltage, and the net charge and charge distribution of the polypeptides. The dwell time distribution depends non-monotonically on the applied voltage (regardless of the polymer's net charge), and its maximum value depends on the polypeptide net charge and charge distribution. The maximum dwell time for different polypeptides does not occur at the same applied voltage amplitude, which conceivably might complicate the detection and discrimination of some polypeptide fragments. Although additional experiments, computer simulations, and artificial intelligence research are needed to better understand how to optimize the partitioning of enzymatically cleaved fragments into the AeL nanopore, the method is still capable of accurately identifying proteins.},

With respect to core molecular mechanics technologies we include a status report for the fixed charge and polarizable force fields that can be used with the program and illustrate how the force fields, when used together with new atom typing and parameter assignment modules, have greatly expanded the coverage of organic compounds and medicinally relevant ligands. As we discuss in this review, explicit solvent simulations have been used to guide our design of implicit solvent models based on the generalized Born framework and a novel nonpolar estimator that have recently been incorporated into the program. With IMPACT it is possible to use several different advanced conformational sampling algorithms based on combining features of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The program includes two specialized molecular mechanics modules: Glide, a high-throughput docking program, and QSite, a mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics module. These modules employ the IMPACT infrastructure as a starting point for the construction of the protein model and assignment of molecular mechanics parameters, but have then been developed to meet specialized objectives with respect to sampling and the energy function. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Long-acting injectables are considered one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases as they can afford improved therapeutic efficacy, safety, and patient compliance. The use of polymer materials in such a drug formulation strategy can offer unparalleled diversity owing to the ability to synthesize materials with a wide range of properties. However, the interplay between multiple parameters, including the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer, make it very difficult to intuitively predict the performance of these systems. This necessitates the development and characterization of a wide array of formulation candidates through extensive and time-consuming in vitro experimentation. Machine learning is enabling leap-step advances in a number of fields including drug discovery and materials science. The current study takes a critical step towards data-driven drug formulation development with an emphasis on long-acting injectables. Here we show that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict experimental drug release from these advanced drug delivery systems. We also demonstrate that these trained models can be used to guide the design of new long acting injectables. The implementation of the described data-driven approach has the potential to reduce the time and cost associated with drug formulation development.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

These duplicates are easily recognizable by memorization and may, hence, bias the comparison of image recognition techniques regarding their generalization capability. To eliminate this bias, we provide the "fair CIFAR" (ciFAIR) dataset, where we replaced all duplicates in the test sets with new images sampled from the same domain. We then re-evaluate the classification performance of various popular state-of-the-art CNN architectures on these new test sets to investigate whether recent research has overfitted to memorizing data instead of learning abstract concepts. We find a significant drop in classification accuracy of between 9\% and 14\% relative to the original performance on the duplicate-free test set.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences{\textendash}a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy{\textendash}remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias{\textendash}the graph network{\textendash}which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than \${\O}mega\$(W/{$\smallin$}) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 - {$\smallin$} fraction of the future test examples.},

  abstract = {A major problem in machine learning is that of inductive bias: how to choose a learner's hypothesis space so that it is large enough to contain a solution to the problem being learnt, yet small enough to ensure reliable generalization from reasonably-sized training sets. Typically such bias is supplied by hand through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks, and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit bounds are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an environment of related tasks can potentially give much better generalization than learning a single task.},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias{\textendash}variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias{\textendash}variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias{\textendash}variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

  abstract = {In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value distribution: the distribution of the random return received by a reinforcement learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution impacts learning in the approximate setting.},

  abstract = {Novel computer vision architectures monopolize the spotlight, but the impact of the model architecture is often conflated with simultaneous changes to training methodology and scaling strategies. Our work revisits the canonical ResNet (He et al., 2015) and studies these three aspects in an effort to disentangle them. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan \& Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures, ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2\% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent. The training techniques improve transfer performance on a suite of downstream tasks (rivaling state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms) and extend to video classification on Kinetics-400. We recommend practitioners use these simple revised ResNets as baselines for future research.},

FUS-positive inclusions in FTLD and ALS patients are consistently co-labeled with stress granule (SG) marker proteins. Whether TDP-43 inclusions contain SG markers is currently still debated. We determined the requirements for SG recruitment of FUS and TDP-43 and found that cytoplasmic mislocalization is a common prerequisite for SG recruitment of FUS and TDP-43. For FUS, the arginine-glycine-glycine zinc finger domain, which is the protein's main RNA binding domain, is most important for SG recruitment, whereas the glycine-rich domain and RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain have a minor contribution and the glutamine-rich domain is dispensable. For TDP-43, both the RRM1 and the C-terminal glycine-rich domain are required for SG localization. ALS-associated point mutations located in the glycine-rich domain of TDP-43 do not affect SG recruitment. Interestingly, a 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43, which is enriched in FTLD/ALS cortical inclusions but not spinal cord inclusions, fails to be recruited into SG. Consistently, inclusions in the cortex of FTLD patients, which are enriched for C-terminal fragments, are not co-labeled with the SG marker poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP-1), whereas inclusions in spinal cord, which contain full-length TDP-43, are frequently positive for this marker protein. Background: Stress granules (SG) have been implicated in the formation of pathological FUS and TDP-43 inclusions. Results: SG recruitment of FUS and TDP-43 requires cytosolic mislocalization and their main RNA binding domain and glycine-rich domain. Conclusion: FUS and TDP-43 have similar requirements for SG recruitment. Significance: Understanding how FUS and TDP-43 are recruited to SG is critical for understanding FTLD/ALS pathology.},

  abstract = {Inferring the structural properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a challenging yet important problem in biology. Structures are not known for the vast majority of protein sequences, but structure is critical for understanding function. Existing approaches for detecting structural similarity between proteins from sequence are unable to recognize and exploit structural patterns when sequences have diverged too far, limiting our ability to transfer knowledge between structurally related proteins. We newly approach this problem through the lens of representation learning. We introduce a framework that maps any protein sequence to a sequence of vector embeddings - one per amino acid position - that encode structural information. We train bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models on protein sequences with a two-part feedback mechanism that incorporates information from (i) global structural similarity between proteins and (ii) pairwise residue contact maps for individual proteins. To enable learning from structural similarity information, we define a novel similarity measure between arbitrary-length sequences of vector embeddings based on a soft symmetric alignment (SSA) between them. Our method is able to learn useful position-specific embeddings despite lacking direct observations of position-level correspondence between sequences. We show empirically that our multi-task framework outperforms other sequence-based methods and even a top-performing structure-based alignment method when predicting structural similarity, our goal. Finally, we demonstrate that our learned embeddings can be transferred to other protein sequence problems, improving the state-of-the-art in transmembrane domain prediction.},

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2012 James Bergstra and Yoshua Bengio.},

Here, we report an optical microscopy-based approach that detects the field distribution surrounding a charged molecule in solution, revealing geometric features such as the radius and the average rise per basepair of the double helix with up to sub-Angstrom precision, comparable with traditional molecular structure determination techniques like X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Moreover, measurement of the helical radius furnishes an unprecedented view of both hydration and the arrangement of cations at the molecule{\textendash}solvent interface.

  abstract = {Associative phase separation (complex coacervation) in a mixture of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can lead to different types of (inter-)polyelectrolyte complexes (soluble micelles, macroscopic precipitation). In a previous report [Langmuir 2004, 20, 2785-2791], we presented a model for the electrostatic free energy change when (weakly charged) polyelectrolyte forms a homogeneous complex phase. The influence of ionization of the polymer on the electrostatic free energy of the complex was incorporated but the influence of complex density neglected. In the present effort, cylindrical cells are assumed around each polyelectrolyte chain in the complex, and on the basis of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, the electrostatic free energy is calculated as a function of the complex density. After combination with Flory-Huggins mixing free energy terms and minimization of the total free energy, the equilibrium complex density is obtained, for a given ratio of polycations to polyanions in the complex. The analysis is used in an example calculation of polyelectrolyte film formation by alternatingly applying a polycation and a polyanion solution. The calculation suggests that the often observed exponential growth of a polyelectrolyte film when the polymer is weakly charged has a thermodynamic origin:\, the polyelectrolyte complex shifts repeatedly between two equilibrium states of different densities and compositions. However, when the polyelectrolytes are strongly charged the difference in the compositions between the two equilibrium states is very small, and exponential growth by an absorption mechanism is no longer possible.},

Theory is presented to describe the electrostatic free energy change when ionizable (annealed) (macro-)molecules form a macroscopic polyelectrolyte complex. The electrostatic free energy includes an electric term as well as a chemical term that is related to the dissociation of the ionic groups in the polymer. An example calculation for complexation of polyacid with polybase uses a cylindrical diffuse double layer model for free polymer in solution and electroneutrality within the complex and calculates the free energy of the system when the polymer is in solution or in a polyelectrolyte complex. Combined with a term for the nonelectrostatic free energy change upon complexation, a theoretical stability diagram is constructed that relates pH, salt concentration, and mixing ratio, which is in qualitative agreement with an experimental diagram obtained by Bungenberg de Jong (1949) for complex coacervation of arabic gum and gelatin. The theory furthermore explains the increased tendency toward phase separation when the polymer becomes more strongly charged and suggests that complexation of polyacid or polybase with zwitterionic polymer (e.g., protein) of the same charge sign (at the ``wrong side'' of the iso-electric point) may be due (in part) to an induced charge reversal of the protein.},

  abstract = {We compare the performance of two well-established computational algorithms for the calculation of free-energy landscapes of biomolecular systems, umbrella sampling and metadynamics. We look at benchmark systems composed of polyethylene and polypropylene oligomers interacting with lipid (phosphatidylcholine) membranes, aiming at the calculation of the oligomer water-membrane free energy of transfer. We model our test systems at two different levels of description, united-atom and coarse-grained. We provide optimized parameters for the two methods at both resolutions. We devote special attention to the analysis of statistical errors in the two different methods and propose a general procedure for the error estimation in metadynamics simulations. Metadynamics and umbrella sampling yield the same estimates for the water-membrane free energy profile, but metadynamics can be more efficient, providing lower statistical uncertainties within the same simulation time.},

  abstract = {Acidic metabolic waste products accumulate in the tumor microenvironment because of high metabolic activity and insufficient perfusion. In tumors, the acidity of the interstitial space and the relatively well-maintained intracellular pH influence cancer and stromal cell function, their mutual interplay, and their interactions with the extracellular matrix. Tumor pH is spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and the fitness advantage of cancer cells adapted to extracellular acidity is likely particularly evident when they encounter less acidic tumor regions, for instance, during invasion. Through complex effects on genetic stability, epigenetics, cellular metabolism, proliferation, and survival, the compartmentalized pH microenvironment favors cancer development. Cellular selection exacerbates the malignant phenotype, which is further enhanced by acid-induced cell motility, extracellular matrix degradation, attenuated immune responses, and modified cellular and intercellular signaling. In this review, we discuss how the acidity of the tumor microenvironment influences each stage in cancer development, from dysplasia to full-blown metastatic disease.},

Despite the fact that Oxford Nanopore Technologies' devices have been increasingly used in the last few years, there is a lack of high-performing and user-friendly tools to handle the data outputted by both MinION and GridION X5 platforms. Here we present NanoR, a cross-platform R package designed with the purpose to simplify and improve nanopore data visualization. Indeed, NanoR is built on few functions but overcomes the capabilities of existing tools to extract meaningful informations from MinION sequencing data; in addition, as exclusive features, NanoR can deal with GridION X5 sequencing outputs and allows comparison of both MinION and GridION X5 sequencing data in one command.

We characterize these states by a large set of descriptors and employ neural networks to compress this information in a lower-dimensional space, using Fisher's linear discriminant as an objective function to maximize the discriminative power of the network. We test this method on alanine dipeptide, using the nonlinearly separable data set composed by atomic distances. We then study an intermolecular aldol reaction characterized by a concerted mechanism. The resulting variables are able to promote sampling by drawing nonlinear paths in the physical space connecting the fluctuations between metastable basins. Lastly, we interpret the behavior of the neural network by studying its relation to the physical variables. Through the identification of its most relevant features, we are able to gain chemical insight into the process.},

  abstract = {The development of enhanced sampling methods has greatly extended the scope of atomistic simulations, allowing long-time phenomena to be studied with accessible computational resources. Many such methods rely on the identification of an appropriate set of collective variables. These are meant to describe the system's modes that most slowly approach equilibrium. Once identified, the equilibration of these modes is accelerated by the enhanced sampling method of choice. An attractive way of determining the collective variables is to relate them to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the transfer operator. Unfortunately, this requires knowing the long-term dynamics of the system beforehand, which is generally not available. However, we have recently shown that it is indeed possible to determine efficient collective variables starting from biased simulations. In this paper, we bring the power of machine learning and the efficiency of the recently developed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling method to bear on this approach. The result is a powerful and robust algorithm that, given an initial enhanced sampling simulation performed with trial collective variables or generalized ensembles, extracts transfer operator eigenfunctions using a neural network ansatz and then accelerates them to promote sampling of rare events. To illustrate the generality of this approach we apply it to several systems, ranging from the conformational transition of a small molecule to the folding of a mini-protein and the study of materials crystallization.},

Our model predicts that a relatively wide range of SDA sizes could be used to construct SOD, whereas a narrower range will work for constructing LTA. We also predict that there is potential benefit of including multiple SDAs in each zeolite unit cell, and in the case of LTA with both small and large cavities, there is a strong potential benefit using both small and large SDAs that match the cavities' sizes. We hypothesize that the volume exclusion reduces the configuration space available to the assembling silica units, making it easier for the system to find ordered structures with quasi-spherical cavities.},

According to the current paradigm, the specificity and affinity required for these interactions are encoded in the precise complementarity of binding interfaces. Even proteins that are disordered under physiological conditions or that contain large unstructured regions commonly interact with well-structured binding sites on other biomolecules. Here we demonstrate the existence of an unexpected interaction mechanism: the two intrinsically disordered human proteins histone H1 and its nuclear chaperone prothymosin-{$\alpha$} associate in a complex with picomolar affinity, but fully retain their structural disorder, long-range flexibility and highly dynamic character. On the basis of closely integrated experiments and molecular simulations, we show that the interaction can be explained by the large opposite net charge of the two proteins, without requiring defined binding sites or interactions between specific individual residues. Proteome-wide sequence analysis suggests that this interaction mechanism may be abundant in eukaryotes.},

In the clinical sample, we identify and directly phase two non-synonymous de novo variants in SAMD9L, (OMIM \#159550) inferring that they lie on the same paternal haplotype. Whilst consensus SNV-calling error rates from ONT data remain substantially higher than those from short-read methods, we demonstrate the substantial benefits of analytical innovation.

Translating these signals into DNA bases (base calling) is a highly non-trivial task, and its quality has a large impact on the sequencing accuracy. The most successful nanopore base callers to date use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accomplish the task. Convolutional layers in CNNs are typically composed of filters with constant window size, performing best in analysis of signals with uniform speed. However, the speed of nanopore sequencing varies greatly both within reads and between sequencing runs. Here, we present dynamic pooling, a novel neural network component, which addresses this problem by adaptively adjusting the pooling ratio. To demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic pooling, we developed two base callers: Heron and Osprey. Heron improves the accuracy beyond the experimental high-accuracy base caller Bonito developed by Oxford Nanopore. Osprey is a fast base caller that can compete in accuracy with Guppy high-accuracy mode, but does not require GPU acceleration and achieves a near real-time speed on common desktop CPUs.

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {Nanopores hold great promise as single-molecule analytical devices and biophysical model systems because the ionic current blockades they produce contain information about the identity, concentration, structure, and dynamics of target molecules. The porin MspA of Mycobacterium smegmatis has remarkable stability against environmental stresses and can be rationally modified based on its crystal structure. Further, MspA has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for DNA sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a ssDNA molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an MspA mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of ssDNA as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of {$\approx$}20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed ssDNA to reside in the vestibule {$\approx$}100 times longer than the first mutant. Our results introduce MspA as a nanopore for nucleic acid analysis and highlight its potential as an engineerable platform for single-molecule detection and characterization applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Although the discovery of the critical role of {$\alpha$}-synuclein ({$\alpha$}-syn) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is now twenty-five years old, it still represents a milestone in PD research. Abnormal forms of {$\alpha$}-syn trigger selective and progressive neuronal death through mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and alteration of calcium homeostasis not only in PD but also in other {$\alpha$}-syn-related neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Furthermore, {$\alpha$}-syn-dependent early synaptic and plastic alterations and the underlying mechanisms preceding overt neurodegeneration have attracted great interest. In particular, the presence of early inflammation in experimental models and PD patients, occurring before deposition and spreading of {$\alpha$}-syn, suggests a mechanistic link between inflammation and synaptic dysfunction. The knowledge of these early mechanisms is of seminal importance to support the research on reliable biomarkers to precociously identify the disease and possible disease-modifying therapies targeting {$\alpha$}-syn. In this review, we will discuss these critical issues, providing a state of the art of the role of this protein in early PD and other synucleinopathies.},

However, its performance is signif- cantly affected by the choice of hyperparameter values. Existing approaches for optimizing the HMC hyperparameters either optimize a proxy for mixing speed or consider the HMC chain as an implicit variational distribution and optimize a tractable lower bound that can be very loose in practice. Instead, we propose to optimize an objective that quantifes directly the speed of con- vergence to the target distribution. Our objective can be easily optimized using stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate our proposed method and compare to baselines on a variety of problems including sampling from synthetic 2D distribu- tions, reconstructing sparse signals, learning deep latent variable models and sampling molecular confgurations from the Boltzmann distribution of a 22 atom molecule. We fnd that our method is competitive with or improves upon alternative baselines in all these experiments. 1.},

This complexity is reflected in the size of the state space, which grows exponentially with the number of particles, reminiscent of the 'curse of dimensionality' commonly encountered in machine learning. Despite this curse, the machine learning community has developed techniques with remarkable abilities to recognize, classify, and characterize complex sets of data. Here, we show that modern machine learning architectures, such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks, can identify phases and phase transitions in a variety of condensed-matter Hamiltonians. Readily programmable through modern software libraries, neural networks can be trained to detect multiple types of order parameter, as well as highly non-trivial states with no conventional order, directly from raw state configurations sampled with Monte Carlo.},

We show evidence, from an examination of the distribution of pairwise distances between frames, that some features of the free-energy surface are inherently high-dimensional. This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

We present a theoretical and experimental framework based on straight-forward nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion measurements to investigate protein binding mechanisms on sub-millisecond timescales, which are beyond the reach of standard rapid-mixing experiments. This framework predicts that conformational selection prevails on ubiquitin's paradigmatic interaction with an SH3 (Src-homology 3) domain. By contrast, the SH3 domain recognizes ubiquitin in a two-state binding process. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling reveal that the ubiquitin conformation selected for binding exhibits a characteristically extended C-terminus. Our framework is robust and expandable for implementation in other binding scenarios with the potential to show that conformational selection might be the design principle of the hubs in protein interaction networks.},

  abstract = {Helicases are components of the cellular replisome that are essential for unwinding double-strand nucleic acids during the process of replication. Intriguingly, most helicases are inefficient and require either oligomerization or assistance from other partner proteins to increase the processivity of unwinding in the presence of the replication fork, which acts as a barrier to progress. Single-molecule force spectroscopy has emerged as a promising experimental technique to probe how relieving this barrier on the helicase can allow for increased efficiency of unwinding. However, there exists no comprehensive theoretical framework to provide unique interpretations of the underlying helicase kinetics from the force spectroscopy data. This remains a major confounding issue in the field. Here, we develop a mathematical framework and derive analytic expressions for the velocity and run length of a general model of finitely processive helicases, the two most commonly measured experimental quantities. We show that in contrast to the unwinding velocity, the processivity exhibits a universal increase in response to external force, irrespective of the underlying architecture and unwinding kinetics of the helicase. Our work provides the first, to our knowledge, explanation to a wide array of experiments and suggests that helicases may have evolved to maximize processivity rather than speed. To demonstrate the use of our theory on experimental data, we analyze velocity and processivity data on the T7 helicase and provide unique inferences on the kinetics of the helicase. Our results show that T7 is a weakly active helicase that destabilizes the fork ahead by less than 1 kBT and back steps very frequently while unwinding DNA. Our work generates fundamental insights into the force response of helicases and provides a widely applicable method for inferring the underlying helicase kinetics from force spectroscopy data.},

The sequencing process generates a huge amount of data in the form of raw signal contained in fast5 files, which must be compressed to enable efficient storage and transfer. Since the raw data is inherently noisy, lossy compression has potential to significantly reduce space requirements without adversely impacting performance of downstream applications. Results: We explore the use of lossy compression for nanopore raw data using two state-of-the-art lossy time-series compressors, and evaluate the tradeoff between compressed size and basecalling/consensus accuracy. We test several basecallers and consensus tools on a variety of datasets at varying depths of coverage, and conclude that lossy compression can provide 35-50\% further reduction in compressed size of raw data over the state-of-the-art lossless compressor with negligible impact on basecalling accuracy ({$\geq$}0.2\% reduction) and consensus accuracy ({$\geq$}0.002\% reduction). In addition, we evaluate the impact of lossy compression on methylation calling accuracy and observe that this impact is minimal for similar reductions in compressed size, although further evaluation with improved benchmark datasets is required for reaching a definite conclusion. The results suggest the possibility of using lossy compression, potentially on the nanopore sequencing device itself, to achieve significant reductions in storage and transmission costs while preserving the accuracy of downstream applications.

The pearl-necklace structures predicted by theory and observed in simulations with implicit solvent are not clearly seen in snapshots of chain conformations, although there is a clustering of monomers. An analysis of the single chain structure factor using a Kratky plot is misleading and not consistent with an analysis of cluster formation or a visual examination of snapshots. The conformational dynamics, as manifested in the decay of the intermediate scattering function, is relatively insensitive to solvent quality, except for the poorest solvent conditions. In this case the single chain structure factor displays oscillations, and the intermediate scattering function displays a dynamic slowing down at corresponding wavevectors. The simulations suggest that the presence of explicit solvent molecules can be an important aspect of polyelectrolyte behavior in poor solvents.},

Here we establish design rules for implementing this sequence-control in materials known as complex coacervates. These materials are formed by the associative phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes into polyelectrolyte dense (coacervate) and polyelectrolyte dilute (supernatant) phases. We demonstrate that patterns of charges can profoundly affect the charge{\textendash}charge associations that drive this process. Furthermore, we establish the physical origin of this pattern-dependent interaction: there is a nuanced combination of structural changes in the dense coacervate phase and a 1D confinement of counterions due to patterns along polymers in the supernatant phase.},

Congruent with the recent discovery of the nondiffusive topologically frustrated dynamical state (TFDS) that emerges at intermediate confinements between the traditional entropic barrier and reptation regimes, we observe the immobility of {$\lambda$}-DNA in the absence of an electric field. The electrophoretic mobility of the molecule is triggered upon application of an electric field with strength above a threshold value Ec. The existence of the threshold value to elicit mobility is attributed to a large entropic barrier, arising from many entropic traps acting simultaneously on a single molecule. Using the measured Ec which depends on the extent of confinement, we have determined the net entropic barrier of up to 130 kBT, which is responsible for the long-lived metastable TFDS. The net entropic barrier from multiple entropic traps is nonmonotonic with the extent of confinement and tends to vanish at the boundaries of the TFDS with the single-entropic barrier regime at lower confinements and the reptation regime at higher confinements. We present an estimate of the mesh size of the hydrogel that switches off the nondiffusive TFDS and releases chin diffusion in the heavily entangled state.},

Our results show that generally the systems form clusters carrying net macromolecular charges. The stoichiometry of these net-charged macromolecular clusters depends on the overall charge asymmetry, and clusters with certain stoichiometry can dominate the cluster population under a wide range of chain-length and concentration asymmetry. The morphology and stability of these net-charged clusters are closely related to their stoichiometry. When the charge ratio reaches a threshold value, the polyions condense into a single large coacervate cluster, signaling the onset of macroscopic coacervation. The threshold value is less for concentration asymmetry systems than for chain-length asymmetry systems at the same salt concentration. This threshold value decreases with added salt, as salt ions cause merging of small clusters into larger ones, eventually leading to the dominance of a single large cluster. This ``salting-out'' phenomenon is followed by a ``salting-in'' behavior, as further addition of salt dissolves the large cluster. The preferred size and composition of the net-charged clusters observed in the simulation highlight the significant role of length and concentration asymmetry on polyelectrolyte complex coacervation and hint at the possibility of a microstructured liquid.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have revolutionized many real world applications, due to their flexibility in data fitting and accurate predictions for unseen data. A line of research reveals that neural networks can approximate certain classes of functions with an arbitrary accuracy, while the size of the network scales exponentially with respect to the data dimension. Empirical results, however, suggest that networks of moderate size already yield appealing performance. To explain such a gap, a common belief is that many data sets exhibit low dimensional structures, and can be modeled as samples near a low dimensional manifold. In this paper, we prove that neural networks can efficiently approximate functions supported on low dimensional manifolds. The network size scales exponentially in the approximation error, with an exponent depending on the intrinsic dimension of the data and the smoothness of the function. Our result shows that exploiting low dimensional data structures can greatly enhance the efficiency in function approximation by neural networks. We also implement a sub-network that assigns input data to their corresponding local neighborhoods, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {The single most intrinsic property of nonrigid polymer chains is their ability to adopt enormous numbers of chain conformations, resulting in huge conformational entropy. When such macromolecules move in media with restrictive spatial constraints, their trajectories are subjected to reductions in their conformational entropy. The corresponding free energy landscapes are interrupted by entropic barriers separating consecutive spatial domains which function as entropic traps where macromolecules can adopt their conformations more favorably. Movement of macromolecules by negotiating a sequence of entropic barriers is a common paradigm for polymer dynamics in restrictive media. However, if a single chain is simultaneously trapped by many entropic traps, it has recently been suggested that the macromolecule does not undergo diffusion and is localized into a topologically frustrated dynamical state, in apparent violation of Einstein's theorem. Using fluorescently labeled {$\lambda$}-DNA as the guest macromolecule embedded inside a similarly charged hydrogel with more than 95\% water content, we present direct evidence for this new state of polymer dynamics at intermediate confinements. Furthermore, using a combination of theory and experiments, we measure the entropic barrier for a single macromolecule as several tens of thermal energy, which is responsible for the extraordinarily long extreme metastability. The combined theory{\textendash}experiment protocol presented here is a determination of single-molecule entropic barriers in polymer dynamics. Furthermore, this method offers a convenient general procedure to quantify the underlying free energy landscapes behind the ubiquitous phenomenon of movement of single charged macromolecules in crowded environments.},

The interlayer bonding is induced by patterned hydrogenation that leads to the formation of superlattices of two- dimensional nanodiamond domains embedded between the two graphene layers. We generalize a rigorous algorithm for the formation of all possible classes of these superstructures: the structural parameters employed to design such carbon nanocomposites include the commensurate bilayer's twist angle, the stacking type of the nano- domains where the interlayer bonds are formed, the interlayer bond pattern, and the interlayer C-C bond density that is proportional to the concentration of sp3-hybridized interlayer-bonded C atoms. We also analyze systematically the mechanical behavior of these nanocomposite superstructures on the basis of molecular-dynamics simulations of uniaxial tensile straining tests according to a reliable interatomic bond-order potential. We identify a range of structural parameters over which the fracture of these superstructures is ductile, mediated by void formation, growth, and coalescence, contrary to the typical brittle fracture of graphene. We introduce a ductility metric as an order parameter for the brittle-to-ductile transition, demonstrate its direct dependence on the fraction of sp3-hybridized interlayer-bonded C atoms, and show that increasing the fraction of interlayer-bonded C atoms beyond a critical level in certain classes of these superstructures induces their ductile mechanical response.},

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of the solvent environment for biological molecules is crucial for computational biology and drug design. A popular approach to achieve long simulation time scales for large system sizes is to incorporate the effect of the solvent in a mean-field fashion with implicit solvent models. However, a challenge with existing implicit solvent models is that they often lack accuracy or certain physical properties compared to explicit solvent models as the many-body effects of the neglected solvent molecules are difficult to model as a mean field. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) and multi-scale coarse graining (CG) in order to learn implicit solvent models that can approximate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of a given explicit solvent model with arbitrary accuracy, given enough training data. Following the previous ML{\textendash}CG models CGnet and CGSchnet, we introduce ISSNet, a graph neural network, to model the implicit solvent potential of mean force. ISSNet can learn from explicit solvent simulation data and be readily applied to molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the solute conformational distributions under different solvation treatments for two peptide systems. The results indicate that ISSNet models can outperform widely used generalized Born and surface area models in reproducing the thermodynamics of small protein systems with respect to explicit solvent. The success of this novel method demonstrates the potential benefit of applying machine learning methods in accurate modeling of solvent effects for in silico research and biomedical applications.},

This model only receives the SMILES strings of a polymer's repeat units as inputs and considers the SMILES strings as sequential data at the character level. Using this method, there is no need to calculate any additional molecular descriptors or fingerprints of polymers, and thereby, being very computationally efficient. More importantly, it avoids the difficulties to generate molecular descriptors for repeat units containing polymerization point `*'. Results show that the trained model demonstrates reasonable prediction performance on unseen polymer's Tg. Besides, this model is further applied for high-throughput screening on an unlabeled polymer database to identify high-temperature polymers that are desired for applications in extreme environments. Our work demonstrates that the SMILES strings of polymer repeat units can be used as an effective feature representation to develop a chemical language processing model for predictions of polymer Tg. The framework of this model is general and can be used to construct structure{\textendash}property relationships for other polymer properties.},

The research on signal simulation of nanopore sequencing is highly desirable for method developments of nanopore sequencing applications. To improve the simulation accuracy, we propose a novel signal simulation method based on Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU). In this method, the signal processing model based on BiGRU is built to replace the traditional low-pass filter to post-process the ground-truth signal calculated by the input nucleotide sequence and nanopore sequencing pore model. Gaussian noise is then added to the filtered signal to generate the final simulated signal. This method can accurately model the relation between ground-truth signal and real-world sequencing signal through experimental sequencing data. The simulation results reveal that the proposed method utilizing the powerful learning ability of the neural network can generate the simulated signal that is closer to the real-world sequencing signal in the time and frequency domains than the existing simulation method.},

The mounting evidence for each of the classes helps us make our final decision. In this work, we introduce a deep network architecture - prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), that reasons in a similar way: the network dissects the image by finding prototypical parts, and combines evidence from the prototypes to make a final classification. The model thus reasons in a way that is qualitatively similar to the way ornithologists, physicians, and others would explain to people on how to solve challenging image classification tasks. The network uses only image-level labels for training without any annotations for parts of images. We demonstrate our method on the CUB-200-2011 dataset and the Stanford Cars dataset. Our experiments show that ProtoPNet can achieve comparable accuracy with its analogous non-interpretable counterpart, and when several ProtoPNets are combined into a larger network, it can achieve an accuracy that is on par with some of the best-performing deep models. Moreover, ProtoPNet provides a level of interpretability that is absent in other interpretable deep models.},

In addition to Lennard-Jones sites on carbon atoms, this model utilizes Lennard-Jones sites on the centers of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs and canonical ensembles were carried out to calculate the one-component vapor-liquid phase equilibria for methane to n-dodecane, to determine the phase diagram of supercritical ethane and n-heptane mixtures, to obtain the Gibbs free energies of transfer for n-pentane and n-hexane between helium vapor and n-heptane liquid phases, and to study the high-pressure region of the equation of state for n-pentane and n-decane. The explicit-hydrogen representation with its more faithful description of the molecular shape of alkanes allows us to find a set of Lennard-Jones parameters that yields significantly better agreement with experiment for one- and multicomponent phase equilibria than our united-atom alkane model, but the price is higher computational cost. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Chemical Society.},

This phenomenon is associated with a range of increasingly common human disorders, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, type II diabetes, and a number of systemic amyloidoses. In this review, we describe this field of science with particular reference to the advances that have been made over the last decade in our understanding of its fundamental nature and consequences. We list the proteins that are known to be deposited as amyloid or other types of aggregates in human tissues and the disorders with which they are associated, as well as the proteins that exploit the amyloid motif to play specific functional roles in humans. In addition, we summarize the genetic factors that have provided insight into the mechanisms of disease onset. We describe recent advances in our knowledge of the structures of amyloid fibrils and their oligomeric precursors and of the mechanisms by which they are formed and proliferate to generate cellular dysfunction. We show evidence that a complex proteostasis network actively combats protein aggregation and that such an efficient system can fail in some circumstances and give rise to disease. Finally, we anticipate the development of novel therapeutic strategies with which to prevent or treat these highly debilitating and currently incurable conditions.},

It is clear that the aggregation process is generally initiated from partially or completely unfolded forms of the peptides and proteins associated with each disease. Here we show that the intrinsic effects of specific mutations on the rates of aggregation of unfolded polypeptide chains can be correlated to a remarkable extent with changes in simple physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity and charge.

  abstract = {Phase separation and coacervate complex formation of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) were investigated as model pair of oppositely charged, weak polyelectrolytes in aqueous solution. Both fully or partially neutralized PAA (sodium polyacrylate) and PAH were employed. Important factors affecting the complexation were systematically varied including the polyacid/polybase mixing ratio (10-90 wt \%), ionic strength as salt concentration (0-4700 mM), polymer concentration (0.02-2.0 wt \%), pH (5 and 7), and temperature (30-75 {\textdegree}C). Sample turbidity was utilized as an indicator of polyelectrolyte complex formation. Phase separation in the solution was also observed by optical microscopy in the distinguishable forms of either precipitate or coacervate. In the absence of salt, polyelectrolyte complexation always resulted in the formation of a precipitate. In the presence of sodium chloride, complex formation does not take place (neither precipitate nor coacervate) when either polyelectrolyte is present in large excess. Increasing salt concentration causes a change from solid precipitate to fluid coacervate phase, and finally a one-phase polyelectrolyte solution is obtained. Temperature affected the precipitate-to-solution transition only in the case of samples with low concentrations of either PAA or PAH. The data generated led to the construction of phase diagrams that illustrate how the various parameters control the demixing and the precipitate-coacervate-solution phase transitions. We find such phase diagrams for simple, flexible synthetic macromolecular systems to be rare in the polymer science literature. Ternary phase diagrams were prepared, which showed the influence of relative polymer and salt concentration on the phase behavior of the aqueous PAA/PAH system. We believe data such as these will both improve both the reliable applications of polymer coacervates and the development of new macromolecular assemblies based on charge complexation.},

Chain length of the PAA was varied (25 {$<$} Pw {$<$} 700) holding Pw of the PAH constant at 765. The polyacid/polybase mixing ratio (10{\textendash}90 wt \%) and the ionic strength as salt concentration (0{\textendash}3,000 mM) were systematically varied. Sample turbidity was utilized as an indicator of PEC formation, complemented by optical microscopy for discrimination between precipitate and coacervate. Salt-free systems always resulted in PEC precipitates; however, coacervates or polyelectrolyte solutions, respectively, were formed upon exceeding critical salt concentrations, the PEC formation also depending on the employed PAA/PAH ratio. The lower the PAA molecular weight, the lower were the critical salt concentrations required for both the precipitate/coacervate and coacervate/solution transitions. The experimental phase behavior established here is explained by molecular models of coacervate complexation, addressing effects of polyelectrolyte molecular weight and salt screening.},

  abstract = {In recent years, semiconductor photocatalytic process has shown a great potential as a low-cost, environmental friendly and sustainable treatment technology to align with the " zero" waste scheme in the water/wastewater industry. The ability of this advanced oxidation technology has been widely demonstrated to remove persistent organic compounds and microorganisms in water. At present, the main technical barriers that impede its commercialisation remained on the post-recovery of the catalyst particles after water treatment.This paper reviews the recent R\&D progresses of engineered-photocatalysts, photoreactor systems, and the process optimizations and modellings of the photooxidation processes for water treatment. A number of potential and commercial photocatalytic reactor configurations are discussed, in particular the photocatalytic membrane reactors. The effects of key photoreactor operation parameters and water quality on the photo-process performances in terms of the mineralization and disinfection are assessed. For the first time, we describe how to utilize a multi-variables optimization approach to determine the optimum operation parameters so as to enhance process performance and photooxidation efficiency. Both photomineralization and photo-disinfection kinetics and their modellings associated with the photocatalytic water treatment process are detailed. A brief discussion on the life cycle assessment for retrofitting the photocatalytic technology as an alternative waste treatment process is presented. This paper will deliver a scientific and technical overview and useful information to scientists and engineers who work in this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.},

We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation in reaches a competitive 18.7\% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18\% PER in single utterances and 20\% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the at- tention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6\% level.},

Through the work, we identified many MOFs and zeolites with high selectivity (SL+M {$>$} 10) for the group of n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, and 3-methylpentane (linear and monobranched isomers) versus 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane (dibranched isomers). This group of selective sorbents includes VICDOC (Fe2(BDP)3), a MOF with triangular pores that is known to exhibit high isomer selectivity and capacity. For three of these structures, the adsorption isotherms for a 10-component mixture of hexane and heptane isomers were calculated. Subsequent simulations of column breakthrough curves showed that the DEYVUA MOF exhibits a longer process cycle time than VICDOC MOF or MRE zeolite, which are previously reported, high-performing materials, illustrating the importance of capacity in designing MOFs for practical applications. Among the identified candidates, we synthesized and characterized a MOF in a new copper form with high predicted adsorbent capacity (qL+M {$>$} 1.2 mol/L) and moderately high selectivity (SL+M {$\approx$} 10). Finally, we examined the role of pore shape in hexane isomer separations, especially of triangular-shaped pores. We show through the potential energy surface and three-dimensional siting analyses that linear alkanes do not populate the corners of narrow triangular channels and that structures with nontriangular pores can efficiently separate hexane isomers. Detailed thermodynamic analysis illustrates how differences in the free energy of adsorption contribute to shape-selective separation in nanoporous materials.},

The computation-ready, experimental (CoRE) MOF database contains over 4700 porous structures with publically available atomic coordinates. Important physical and chemical properties including the surface area and pore dimensions are reported for these structures. To demonstrate the utility of the database, we performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of methane adsorption on all structures in the CoRE MOF database. We investigated the structural properties of the CoRE MOFs that govern methane storage capacity and found that these relationships agree well with those derived recently from a large database of hypothetical MOFs.},

Com- plementary to these works, we propose meth- ods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT's attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to delimiter tokens, specific po- sitional offsets, or broadly attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic notions of syntax and coref- erence. For example, we find heads that at- tend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and corefer- ent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT's attention.},

Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice.

In this paper, we present a new approach that has been successful in gathering insights on the transcription process in Escherichia coli. This work builds upon a transformer-based neural network framework designed for prokaryotic genome annotation purposes. We find that the majority of subunits (attention heads) of the model are specialized towards identifying transcription factors and are able to successfully characterize both their binding sites and consensus sequences, uncovering both well-known and potentially novel elements involved in the initiation of the transcription process. With the specialization of the attention heads occurring automatically, we believe transformer models to be of high interest towards the creation of explainable neural networks in this field.},

Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

Simple atom and bond attributes are used to construct atom-specific feature vectors that take into account the local chemical environment using different neighborhood radii. By working directly with the full molecular graph, there is a greater opportunity for models to identify important features relevant to a prediction task. Unlike other graph-based approaches, our atom featurization preserves molecule-level spatial information that significantly enhances model performance. Our models learn to identify important features of atom clusters for the prediction of aqueous solubility, octanol solubility, melting point, and toxicity. Extensions and limitations of this strategy are discussed.},

  abstract = {Designing functional molecules with desirable properties is often a challenging, multi-objective optimization. For decades, there have been computational approaches to facilitate this process through the simulation of physical processes, the prediction of molecular properties using structure{\textendash}property relationships, and the selection or generation of molecular structures. This review provides an overview of some algorithmic approaches to defining and exploring chemical spaces that have the potential to operationalize the process of molecular discovery. We emphasize the potential roles of machine learning and the consideration of synthetic feasibility, which is a prerequisite to `closing the loop'. We conclude by summarizing important directions for the future development and evaluation of these methods.},

Synthetic routes are proposed through generalization of millions of published chemical reactions and validated in silico to maximize their likelihood of success. Additional implementation details are determined by expert chemists and recorded in reusable recipe files, which are executed by a modular continuous-flow platform that is automatically reconfigured by a robotic arm to set up the required unit operations and carry out the reaction.

In this context, microparticle-based displays1,2,3,4,5 have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1{\textendash}5\,{$\mu$}m), quite distinct from the molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays6. Microparticle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an `ink on paper' look7. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion8. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.},

The approach combines two techniques: self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to predict the structure of the self-assembled, solvated membrane and on-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to model diffusion of solutes. Solvation is simulated in SCFT by constraining the glassy membrane matrix while relaxing the brush-like membrane pore coating against the solvent. The kMC simulations capture the resulting solute spatial distribution and concentration-dependent local diffusivity in the polymer-coated pores; we parameterize the latter using particle-based simulations. We apply our approach to simulate solute diffusion through nonequilibrium morphologies of a model triblock copolymer, and we correlate diffusivity with structural descriptors of the morphologies. We also compare the model's predictions to alternative approaches based on simple lattice random walks and find our multiscale model to be more robust and systematic to parameterize. Our multiscale modeling approach is general and can be readily extended in the future to other chemistries, morphologies, and models for the local solute diffusivity and interactions with the membrane.},

Beyond helping CNNs to handle long-range dependencies, Ramachandran et al. (2019) showed that attention can completely replace convolution and achieve state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. This raises the question: do learned attention layers operate similarly to convolutional layers? This work provides evidence that attention layers can perform convolution and, indeed, they often learn to do so in practice. Specifically, we prove that a multi-head self-attention layer with sufficient number of heads is at least as expressive as any convolutional layer. Our numerical experiments then show that self-attention layers attend to pixel-grid patterns similarly to CNN layers, corroborating our analysis. Our code is publicly available.},

  abstract = {The moments of mathematical distributions allow calculation of various statistical parameters of the distribution and provide quantitative measures of its shape. In cases where the distribution is a polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD), the moments can be used to calculate the number- and weight-average molecular weights of the sample and the standard deviation and other higher order statistical parameters of the representative (e.g., chain length and mass) distributions. In this work, the moments of distributions are used to develop powerful equations that allow the statistical parameters of any arbitrary mixture of molecular weight distributions to be calculated. These equations take the average molecular weights and mass fractions of polymer samples as inputs and provide the corresponding molecular weight averages of the mixed sample as outputs. Various statistical parameters of the representative number and weight distributions can then be easily and accurately attained using the calculated molecular weight averages. As a representative example of the power of this approach, blended polymer MWDs were encoded with characters and accurately and rapidly decoded using the developed equations. Overall, as this polymer blending approach is developed from a mathematical standpoint, there are practically no limits to the number or type of component distributions in the mixture, thus providing a much simpler route for designing polymer mixtures with tightly controlled statistical properties.},

In simple cylindrical channels, considerable differences are found between the two theories with regard to the concentration profiles in the channel and its conductance properties. These differences are at a maximum in narrow channels with a radius smaller than the Debye length and diminish with increasing radius. Convergence occurs when the channel radius is over 2 Debye lengths.

In principle, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can investigate these issues, but with current computer facilities, these simulations have been limited to small RNAs and to short times. HiRe-RNA, a recently proposed high-resolution coarse-grained RNA that captures many geometric details such as base pairing and stacking, is able to fold RNA molecules to near-native structures in a short computational time. So far, it had been applied to simple hairpins, and here we present its application to duplexes of a couple dozen nucleotides and show how with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) we can easily predict the correct double helix from a completely random configuration and study the dissociation curve. To show the versatility of our model, we present an application to a double stranded DNA molecule as well. A reconstruction algorithm allows us to obtain full atom structures from the coarse-grained model. Through atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), we can compare the dynamics starting from a representative structure of a low temperature replica or from the experimental structure, and show how the two are statistically identical, highlighting the validity of a coarse-grained approach for structured RNAs and DNAs. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The DNA and RNA nu-cleobases are known to affect the kinetics of these systems in biologically meaningful ways. Recently, it was shown that DNA bases control the translocation speed of helicases on single-stranded DNA, however the cause of these effects remains unclear. We use single-molecule picometer-resolution nanopore tweezers (SPRNT) to measure the kinetics of translocation along single-stranded DNA by the helicase Hel308 from Thermococcus gammatolerans. SPRNT can measure enzyme steps with subangstrom resolution on millisecond timescales while simultaneously measuring the absolute position of the enzyme along the DNA substrate. Previous experiments with SPRNT revealed the presence of two distinct substates within the Hel308 ATP hydrolysis cycle, one [ATP]-dependent and the other [ATP]-independent. Here, we analyze in-depth the apparent sequence dependent behavior of the [ATP]-independent step. We find that DNA bases at two sites within Hel308 control sequence-specific kinetics of the [ATP]-independent step. We suggest mechanisms for the observed sequence-specific translocation kinetics. Similar SPRNT measurements and methods can be applied to other nucleic-acid-processing motor enzymes.},

Here we demonstrate that by revisiting model configurations as basic as scaling of embeddings, early stopping, relative positional embedding, and Universal Transformer variants, we can drastically improve the performance of Transformers on systematic generalization. We report improvements on five popular datasets: SCAN, CFQ, PCFG, COGS, and Mathematics dataset. Our models improve accuracy from 50\% to 85\% on the PCFG productivity split, and from 35\% to 81\% on COGS. On SCAN, relative positional embedding largely mitigates the EOS decision problem (Newman et al., 2020), yielding 100\% accuracy on the length split with a cutoff at 26. Importantly, performance differences between these models are typically invisible on the IID data split. This calls for proper generalization validation sets for developing neural networks that generalize systematically. We publicly release the code to reproduce our results1.},

However, the RBM model is usually not directly accessible due to its computational complexity, and Markov-chain sampling is invoked to analyze the learned probability distribution. For training and eventual applications, it is thus desirable to have a sampler that is both accurate and efficient. We highlight that these two goals generally compete with each other and cannot be achieved simultaneously. More specifically, we identify and quantitatively characterize three regimes of RBM learning: independent learning, where the accuracy improves without losing efficiency; correlation learning, where higher accuracy entails lower efficiency; and degradation, where both accuracy and efficiency no longer improve or even deteriorate. These findings are based on numerical experiments and heuristic arguments.},

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced "coat" nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights:(1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets. For example, CoAtNet achieves 86.0\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy without extra data, and 89.77\% with extra JFT data, outperforming prior arts of both convolutional networks and Transformers.

  abstract = {The synthesis of ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers using reversible deactivation radical polymerisation techniques remains a challenge and has been the centre of attention only in a limited number of studies. Although UHMW polymers were synthesised in these research studies, the complexity in architecture has mainly been limited to linear homopolymers and AB diblock copolymers. We hereby report a new pathway to synthesise UHMW ABA triblock copolymers using a combination of reversible addition{\textendash}fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation, end-group modification by aminolysis and chain coupling. A simple aqueous RAFT-mediated gel polymerisation technique was initially employed to synthesise high molecular weight AB diblock copolymers with low dispersities ({\DJ} {$<$} 1.50). The use of the said gel polymerisation method in combination with a redox initiation system allowed for the rapid chain propagation of water-soluble monomers at a low reaction temperature of 20 {\textdegree}C. These polymers were subsequently treated by aminolysis to convert the chain end into a thiol functionality, which spontaneously coupled under oxidative conditions to form a disulfide bridge between the AB diblock copolymers to produce the final UHMW ABA triblock copolymers (Mn,SEC {$>$} 1000k; {\DJ} {$<$} 1.70).},

  abstract = {The functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are governed by relationships between information encoded in their amino acid sequences and the ensembles of conformations that they sample as autonomous units. Most IDPs are polyampholytes, with sequences that include both positively and negatively charged residues. Accordingly, we focus here on the sequence{\textendash}ensemble relationships of polyampholytic IDPs. The fraction of charged residues discriminates between weak and strong polyampholytes. Using atomistic simulations, we show that weak polyampholytes form globules, whereas the conformational preferences of strong polyampholytes are determined by a combination of fraction of charged residues values and the linear sequence distributions of oppositely charged residues. We quantify the latter using a patterning parameter {$\kappa$} that lies between zero and one. The value of {$\kappa$} is low for well-mixed sequences, and in these sequences, intrachain electrostatic repulsions and attractions are counterbalanced, leading to the unmasking of preferences for conformations that resemble either self-avoiding random walks or generic Flory random coils. Segregation of oppositely charged residues within linear sequences leads to high {$\kappa$}-values and preferences for hairpin-like conformations caused by long-range electrostatic attractions induced by conformational fluctuations. We propose a scaling theory to explain the sequence-encoded conformational properties of strong polyampholytes. We show that naturally occurring strong polyampholytes have low {$\kappa$}-values, and this feature implies a selection for random coil ensembles. The design of sequences with different {$\kappa$}-values demonstrably alters the conformational preferences of polyampholytic IDPs, and this ability could become a useful tool for enabling direct inquiries into connections between sequence{\textendash}ensemble relationships and functions of IDPs.},

  abstract = {We report results of a systematic study on the complex oscillatory current-driven dynamics of single-layer homoepitaxial islands on crystalline substrate surfaces and the dependence of this driven dynamical behavior on important physical parameters, including island size, substrate surface orientation, and direction of externally applied electric field. The analysis is based on a nonlinear model of driven island edge morphological evolution that accounts for curvature-driven edge diffusion, edge electromigration, and edge diffusional anisotropy. Using a linear theory of island edge morphological stability, we calculate a critical island size at which the island's equilibrium edge shape becomes unstable, which sets a lower bound for the onset of time-periodic oscillatory dynamical response. Using direct dynamical simulations, we study the edge morphological dynamics of current-driven single-layer islands at larger-than-critical size, and determine the actual island size at which the migrating islands undergo a transition from steady to time-periodic asymptotic states through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. At the highest symmetry of diffusional anisotropy examined, on 111 surfaces of face-centered cubic crystalline substrates, we find that more complex stable oscillatory states can be reached through period-doubling bifurcation at island sizes larger than those at the Hopf points. We characterize in detail the island morphology and dynamical response at the stable time-periodic asymptotic states, determine the range of stability of these oscillatory states terminated by island breakup, and explain the morphological features of the stable oscillating islands on the basis of linear stability theory.},

Accounting for electrostatic and excluded volume interactions based on the protein sequence, our Langevin dynamics simulations reveal that {$\alpha$}-synuclein molecules assemble into aggregates and percolated structures with a spontaneous selection of a dominant structure characteristic of microphase separation. This microphase assembly is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions between the residues in N-terminal and C-terminal of the protein molecules, and presence of salt loosens the compactness of the microstructures. We have quantified the features of the spontaneously formed microstructures using interchain radial distribution functions, and experimentally measurable inter-residue contact maps and static structure factors. Our results are in contrast to the commonly hypothesized mechanism of liquid{\textendash}liquid phase separation (LLPS) for the formation of droplets in solutions of intrinsically disordered proteins, opening a new paradigm to understand the birth and structure of membraneless organelles. In general, construction of phase diagrams of intrinsically disordered proteins and other biomacromolecular systems needs to incorporate features of microphase separation into other mechanisms of macrophase separation and percolation.},

  abstract = {Protein biomaterials offer several advantages over those made from other components because their amino acid sequence can be precisely controlled with genetic engineering to produce a diverse set of material building blocks. In this work, three different elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) sequences were designed to synthesize pH-responsive protein vesicles. ELPs undergo a thermally induced hydrophobic transition that enables self-assembly of different kinds of protein biomaterials. The transition can be tuned by the composition of the guest residue, X, within the ELP pentapeptide repeat unit, VPGXG. When the guest residue is substituted with an ionizable amino acid, such as histidine, the ELP undergoes a pH-dependent hydrophobic phase transition. We used pH-responsive ELPs with different levels of histidine substitution, in combination with leucine zippers and globular, functional proteins, to fabricate protein vesicles. We demonstrate pH-dependent self-assembly, diameter, and disassembly of the vesicles using a combination of turbidimetry, dynamic light scattering, microscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering. As the ELP transition is dependent on the sequence, the vesicle properties also depend on the histidine content in the ELP building blocks. These results demonstrate the tunability of protein vesicles endowed with pH responsiveness, which expands their potential in drug-delivery applications.},

However, the MinION currently relies on a cloud computing platform, Metrichor (metrichor.com), for translating locally generated sequencing data into basecalls. Results: To allow offline and private analysis of MinION data, we created Nanocall. Nanocall is the first freely available, open-source basecaller for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data and does not require an internet connection. Using R7.3 chemistry, on two E.coli and two human samples, with natural as well as PCR-amplified DNA, Nanocall reads have {$\sim$}68\% identity, directly comparable to Metrichor '1D' data. Further, Nanocall is efficient, processing {$\sim$}2500 Kbp of sequence per core hour using the fastest settings, and fully parallelized. Using a 4 core desktop computer, Nanocall could basecall a MinION sequencing run in real time. Metrichor provides the ability to integrate the '1D' sequencing of template and complement strands of a single DNA molecule, and create a '2D' read. Nanocall does not currently integrate this technology, and addition of this capability will be an important future development. In summary, Nanocall is the first open-source, freely available, off-line basecaller for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data.},

Alas, scaling Bayesian inference to large weight spaces often requires restrictive approximations. In this work, we show that it suffices to perform inference over a small subset of model weights in order to obtain accurate predictive posteriors. The other weights are kept as point estimates. This subnetwork inference framework enables us to use expressive, otherwise intractable, posterior approximations over such subsets. In particular, we implement subnetwork linearized Laplace: We first obtain a MAP estimate of all weights and then infer a full-covariance Gaussian posterior over a subnetwork. We propose a subnetwork selection strategy that aims to maximally preserve the model's predictive uncertainty. Empirically, our approach is effective compared to ensembles and less expressive posterior approximations over full networks.},

For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and driving the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAPs) has emerged as an elegant framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, underlying the development of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a regularized entropy match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that enable the navigation of alchemical and structural complexities within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal mol-1, reaching an important milestone in the application of machine-learning techniques for the evaluation of molecular properties.},

However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious `shortcuts'. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired `shortcuts' learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models.},

The benchmark lottery postulates that many factors, other than fundamental algorithmic superiority, may lead to a method being perceived as superior. On multiple benchmark setups that are prevalent in the ML community, we show that the relative performance of algorithms may be altered significantly simply by choosing different benchmark tasks, highlighting the fragility of the current paradigms and potential fallacious interpretation derived from benchmarking ML methods. Given that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important, we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss implications of the observed phenomena and provide recommendations on mitigating them using multiple machine learning domains and communities as use cases, including natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, recommender systems and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long read sequencers offer access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than high-GC reads (about 6\% and 8\% respectively). The error profile for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an open source pipeline for long-term monitoring of the error profile, which enables users to easily compute various analysis presented in this work, including for future developments of the sequencing device. Overall, we hope this work will provide a basis for the design of better error-correction methods.},

  abstract = {The complexation of mixtures of cationic and anionic polymers to produce complex-coacervate phases is a subject of fundamental importance to colloid and polymer science as well as to applications including drug delivery, sensing technologies, and bio-inspired adhesives. Unfortunately the theoretical underpinnings of complex coacervation are widely misunderstood and conceptual mistakes have propagated in the literature. Here, a simple symmetric polyelectrolyte mixture model in the absence of salt is used to discuss the salient features of the phase diagram, including the location of the critical point, binodals, and spinodals. It is argued that charge compensation by dimerization in the dilute region renders the phase diagram of an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte mixture qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of a single-component symmetric diblock polyampholyte solution, a system capable of ``self-coacervation.'' The theoretical predictions are verified using fully fluctuating field-theoretic simulations for corresponding polyelectrolyte and diblock polyampholyte models. These represent the first comprehensive, approximation-free phase diagrams for coacervate and self-coacervate systems to appear in the literature.},

  abstract = {Large-scale simulations with complex electron interactions remain one of the greatest challenges for atomistic modelling. Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10\,years of density functional theory calculations of more than 1.5\,million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase diagram for LixFePO4 and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We highlight the significance of charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that cannot be observed by previous MLIPs.},

The motivation stems from the fact that spectrograms form recognisable images, that can be identified by a human reader, with perception enhanced by pseudo-coloration of the image. The signal processing in our method is as follows. 1) The spectrogram is normalised into greyscale with a fixed range. 2) The dynamic range is quantized into regions, each of which is then mapped to form a monochrome image. 3) The monochrome images are partitioned into blocks, and the distribution statistics in each block are extracted to form the feature. The robustness of the proposed method comes from the fact that the noise is normally more diffuse than the signal and therefore the effect of the noise is limited to a particular quantization region, leaving the other regions less changed. The method is tested on a database of 60 sound classes containing a mixture of collision, action and characteristic sounds and shows a significant improvement over other methods in mismatched conditions, without the need for noise reduction. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

The simplest form of nanopore DNA sequencing utilizes the hypothesis that individual nucleotides of single-stranded DNA passing through a nanopore will uniquely modulate an ionic current flowing through the pore, allowing the record of the current to yield the DNA sequence. We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore.

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {DNA molecules can electrophoretically be driven through a nanoscale opening in a material, giving rise to rich and measurable ionic current blockades. In this work, we train machine learning models on experimental ionic blockade data from DNA nucleotide translocation through 2D pores of different diameters. The aim of the resulting classification is to enhance the read-out efficiency of the nucleotide identity providing pathways toward error-free sequencing. We propose a novel method that at the same time reduces the current traces to a few physical descriptors and trains low-complexity models, thus reducing the dimensionality of the data. We describe each translocation event by four features including the height of the ionic current blockade. Training on these lower dimensional data and utilizing deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, we can reach a high accuracy of up to 94\% in average. Compared to more complex baseline models trained on the full ionic current traces, our model outperforms. Our findings clearly reveal that the use of the ionic blockade height as a feature together with a proper combination of neural networks, feature extraction, and representation provides a strong enhancement in the detection. Our work points to a possible step toward guiding the experiments to the number of events necessary for sequencing an unknown biopolymer in view of improving the biosensitivity of novel nanopore sequencers.},

  abstract = {Since the seminal paper by Panagiotopoulos [Mol. Phys. 61, 813 (1997)], the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method has been the most popular particle-based simulation approach for the computation of vapor{\textendash}liquid phase equilibria. However, the validity of GEMC simulations in the near-critical region has been questioned because rigorous finite-size scaling approaches cannot be applied to simulations with fluctuating volume. Valleau [Mol. Simul. 29, 627 (2003)] has argued that GEMC simulations would lead to a spurious overestimation of the critical temperature. More recently, Patel et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 024101 (2011)] opined that the use of analytical tail corrections would be problematic in the near-critical region. To address these issues, we perform extensive GEMC simulations for Lennard-Jones particles in the near-critical region varying the system size, the overall system density, and the cutoff distance. For a system with N = 5500 particles, potential truncation at 8{$\sigma$} and analytical tail corrections, an extrapolation of GEMC simulation data at temperatures in the range from 1.27 to 1.305 yields T{\textbackslash}nc = 1.3128 {$\pm$} 0.0016, {$\rho\backslash$}nc = 0.316 {$\pm$} 0.004, and p{\textbackslash}nc = 0.1274 {$\pm$} 0.0013 in excellent agreement with the thermodynamic limit determined by Potoff and Panagiotopoulos [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 10914 (1998)] using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. Critical properties estimated using GEMC simulations with different overall system densities (0.296 {$\leq$} {$\rho\backslash$}nt {$\leq$} 0.336) agree to within the statistical uncertainties. For simulations with tail corrections, data obtained using r{\textbackslash}ncut = 3.5{$\sigma$} yield T{\textbackslash}nc and p{\textbackslash}nc that are higher by 0.2\% and 1.4\% than simulations with r{\textbackslash}ncut = 5 and 8{$\sigma$} but still with overlapping 95\% confidence intervals. In contrast, GEMC simulations with a truncated and shifted potential show that r{\textbackslash}ncut = 8{$\sigma$} is insufficient to obtain accurate results. Additional GEMC simulations for hard-core square-well particles with various ranges of the attractive well and for n-decane molecules represented by the TraPPE force field yield data that support the trends observed for Lennard-Jones particles. The finite-size dependence of the critical properties obtained from GEMC simulations is significantly smaller than those from grand-canonical ensemble simulations. Thus, when resources are not available for a rigorous finite-size scaling study, GEMC simulations provide a straightforward route to determine fairly accurate critical properties using relatively small system sizes.},

  abstract = {Structure and dynamics are both critical to RNA's vital functions in biology. Numerous techniques can elucidate the structural dynamics of RNA, but computational approaches based on experimental data arguably hold the promise of providing the most detail. In this Account, we highlight areas wherein molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanical (QM) techniques are applied to RNA, particularly in relation to complementary experimental studies. We have expanded on atomic-resolution crystal structures of RNAs in functionally relevant states by applying explicit solvent MD simulations to explore their dynamics and conformational changes on the submicrosecond time scale. MD relies on simplified atomistic, pairwise additive interaction potentials (force fields). Because of limited sampling, due to the finite accessible simulation time scale and the approximated force field, high-quality starting structures are required. Despite their imperfection, we find that currently available force fields empower MD to provide meaningful and predictive information on RNA dynamics around a crystallographically defined energy minimum. The performance of force fields can be estimated by precise QM calculations on small model systems. Such calculations agree reasonably well with the Cornell et al. AMBER force field, particularly for stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. A final verification of any force field is accomplished by simulations of complex nucleic acid structures. The performance of the Cornell et al. AMBER force field generally corresponds well with and augments experimental data, but one notable exception could be the capping loops of double-helical stems. In addition, the performance of pairwise additive force fields is obviously unsatisfactory for inclusion of divalent cations, because their interactions lead to major polarization and charge-transfer effects neglected by the force field. Neglect of polarization also limits, albeit to a lesser extent, the description accuracy of other contributions, such as interactions with monovalent ions, conformational flexibility of the anionic sugar-phosphate backbone, hydrogen bonding, and solute polarization by solvent. Still, despite limitations, MD simulations are a valid tool for analyzing the structural dynamics of existing experimental structures. Careful analysis of MD simulations can identify problematic aspects of an experimental RNA structure, unveil structural characteristics masked by experimental constraints, reveal functionally significant stochastic fluctuations, evaluate the structural role of base ionization, and predict structurally and potentially functionally important details of the solvent behavior, including the presence of tightly bound water molecules. Moreover, combining classical MD simulations with QM calculations in hybrid QM/MM approaches helps in the assessment of the plausibility of chemical mechanisms of catalytic RNAs (ribozymes). In contrast, the reliable prediction of structure from sequence information is beyond the applicability of MD tools. The ultimate utility of computational studies in understanding RNA function thus requires that the results are neither blindly accepted nor flatly rejected, but rather considered in the context of all available experimental data, with great care given to assessing limitations through the available starting structures, force field approximations, and sampling limitations. The examples given in this Account showcase how the judicious use of basic MD simulations has already served as a powerful tool to help evaluate the role of structural dynamics in biological function of RNA.

This contribution is closed with a discussion on the remaining challenges and possible future directions.},

  abstract = {In this work we analyze strategies for convolutional neural network scaling; that is, the process of scaling a base convolutional network to endow it with greater computational complexity and consequently representational power. Example scaling strategies may include increasing model width, depth, resolution, etc. While various scaling strategies exist, their tradeoffs are not fully understood. Existing analysis typically focuses on the interplay of accuracy and flops (floating point operations). Yet, as we demonstrate, various scaling strategies affect model parameters, activations, and consequently actual runtime quite differently. In our experiments we show the surprising result that numerous scaling strategies yield networks with similar accuracy but with widely varying properties. This leads us to propose a simple fast compound scaling strategy that encourages primarily scaling model width, while scaling depth and resolution to a lesser extent. Unlike currently popular scaling strategies, which result in about \$O(s)\$ increase in model activation w.r.t. scaling flops by a factor of \$s\$, the proposed fast compound scaling results in close to \$O({\textbackslash}sqrts)\$ increase in activations, while achieving excellent accuracy. This leads to comparable speedups on modern memory-limited hardware (e.g., GPU, TPU). More generally, we hope this work provides a framework for analyzing and selecting scaling strategies under various computational constraints.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

A gel is treated as a three-phase medium consisting of a solid phase (polymer network), solvent (water), and solute (mobile ions). Transport of solvent and solute is thought of as their diffusion through the polymer network accelerated by an electric field formed by mobile and fixed ions and accompanied by chemical reactions (dissociation of functional groups attached to polymer chains and formation of ion pairs between bound charges and mobile counter-ions). Constitutive equations are derived by means of the free energy imbalance inequality for an arbitrary three-dimensional deformation with finite strains. These relations are applied to analyze equilibrium swelling diagrams on poly(acrylic acid) gel, poly(methacrylic acid) gel, and three composite hydrogels under water uptake in a bath (i) with a fixed molar fraction of salt and varied pH, and (ii) with a fixed pH and varied molar fraction of salt. To validate the ability of the model to predict observations quantitatively, material constants are found by matching swelling curves under one type of experimental conditions and results of simulation are compared with experimental data in the other type of tests.},

Complex formation, generally accompanied by coacervation, occurs abruptly with increasing pH at constant ionic strength. This critical pH, signaled by a rapid increase in turbidity, increases with ionic strength. For BSA, the net protein charge at critical pH is a linear function of ionic strength. Turbidimetric titration curves generated by adding protein to polyion are very different from those obtained when the sequence of addition is reversed, an observation inconsistent with highly cooperative binding. Turbidimetric titrations conducted with mixtures of BSA and RNAse so far have not given clear evidence of selective coacervation, but optimization of ionic strength and polymenprotein stoichiometry may provide better separations.},

Several less-known types of transfer functions and new combinations of activation/output functions are described. Universal transfer functions, parametrized to change from localized to delocalized type, are of greatest interest. Other types of neural transfer functions discussed here include functions with activations based on non- Euclidean distance measures, bicentral functions, formed from products or linear combinations of pairs of sigmoids, and extensions of such functions making rotations of localized decision borders in highly dimensional spaces practical. Nonlinear input preprocessing techniques are briefly described, offering an alternative way to change the shapes of decision borders. Keywords:},

Supported by linear stability theory, self-consistent dynamical simulations based on the model demonstrate that the action over several hours of a sufficiently strong and properly directed electric field on a conducting thin film can reduce its surface roughness and lead to a smooth planar film surface.

To evaluate the model, we benchmark on the rotamer recovery task, the problem of predicting the conformation of a side chain from its context within a protein structure, which has been used to evaluate energy functions for protein design. The model achieves performance close to that of the Rosetta energy function, a state-of-the-art method widely used in protein structure prediction and design.

Using a fully nonlinear model of surface morphological evolution that accounts for a wetting potential contribution to the epitaxial film\&apos;s free energy as well as surface diffusional anisotropy, we demonstrate the formation of multiple QD patterns in self-consistent dynamical simulations of the evolution of the epitaxial film surface perturbed from its planar state. The simulation predictions are supported by weakly nonlinear analysis of the epitaxial film surface morphological stability. We find that, in addition to the Stranski-Krastanow instability, long-wavelength perturbations from the planar film surface morphology can trigger a nonlinear instability, resulting in the splitting of a single QD into multiple QDs of smaller sizes, and predict the critical wavelength of the film surface perturbation for the onset of the nonlinear tip-splitting instability. The theory provides a fundamental interpretation for the observations of ``QD pairs'' or ``double QDs'' and other multiple QDs reported in experimental studies of epitaxial growth of semiconductor strained layers and sets the stage for precise engineering of tunable-size nanoscale surface features in strained-layer heteroepitaxy by exploiting film surface nonlinear, pattern forming phenomena.},

  abstract = {Correctly predicting features of protein structure and function from amino acid sequence alone remains a supreme challenge for computational biology. For almost three decades, state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments. Exponentially growing sequence databases make it infeasible to gather evolutionary information for entire microbiomes or meta-proteomics. On top, for many important proteins (e.g. dark proteome and intrinsically disordered proteins) evolutionary information remains limited. Here, we introduced a novel approach combining recent advances of Language Models (LMs) with multi-task learning to successfully predict aspects of protein structure (secondary structure) and function (cellular component or subcellular localization) without using any evolutionary information from alignments. Our approach fused self-supervised pre-training LMs on an unlabeled big dataset (UniRef50, corresponding to 9.6 billion words) with supervised training on labelled high-quality data in one single end-to-end network. We provided a proof-of-principle for the novel concept through the semi-successful per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure and through per-protein predictions of localization (Q10=69\%) and the distinction between integral membrane and water-soluble proteins (Q2=89\%). Although these results did not reach the levels obtained by the best available methods using evolutionary information from alignments, these less accurate multi-task predictions have the advantage of speed: they are 300-3000 times faster (where HHblits needs 30-300 seconds on average, our method needed 0.045 seconds). These new results push the boundaries of predictability towards grayer and darker areas of the protein space, allowing to make reliable predictions for proteins which were not accessible by previous methods. On top, our method remains scalable as it removes the necessity to search sequence databases for evolutionary related proteins.},

Herein, we take a complementary data-driven approach by building a machine learning framework to make fast and accurate predictions of polymer solution cloud point temperatures. Using polystyrene, both upper and lower critical solution temperatures are predicted within experimental uncertainty (1{\textendash}2 {\textdegree}C) with a deep neural network, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, and a combination of polymer, solvent, and state features. The GPR model also enables intelligent exploration of solution phase space, where as little as 25 cloud points are required to make predictions within 2 {\textdegree}C for polystyrene of arbitrary molecular weight in cyclohexane. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for the prediction of liquid{\textendash}liquid equilibrium of polymer solutions and establishes a framework to incorporate other polymers and complex macromolecular architectures.},

  abstract = {The phase behavior of polymers in solution is crucial to many applications in polymer processing, synthesis, self-assembly, and purification. Quantitative prediction of polymer solubility space for an arbitrary polymer{\textendash}solvent pair and across a large composition range is challenging. Qualitative agreement is provided by many current theoretical models, but only a portion of the phase space is quantitatively predicted. Here, we utilize a curated database for binary polymer solutions comprised of 21 linear polymers, 61 solvents, and 97 unique polymer{\textendash}solvent combinations (6524 cloud point temperatures) to construct phase diagrams from machine learning predictions. A generalizable feature vector is developed that includes component descriptors concatenated with state variables and an experimental data descriptor (phase direction). The impact of several types of descriptors (Morgan fingerprints, molecular descriptors, and Hansen solubility parameters) to encode polymer{\textendash}solvent interactions is assessed. Hansen solubility parameters are also introduced as a means to understand the general breadth of the linear polymer{\textendash}solvent space as well as the density and distribution of curated data. Two common regression algorithms (XGBoost and neural networks) establish the generality of the descriptors; provide a root mean squared error (RMSE) within 3 {\textdegree}C for predicted cloud points in the test set; and offer excellent agreement with upper and lower critical solubility curves, isopleths, and closed-loop phase behavior by a single model. The ability to extrapolate to polymers that are very dissimilar from the curated data is poor, but with as little as 20 cloud points or a single phase boundary, RMSE error of predictions are within 5 {\textdegree}C. This implies that the current model captures aspects of the underlying physics and can readily exploit correlations to reduce required data for additional polymer{\textendash}solvent pairs. Finally, the model and data are accessible via the Polymer Property Predictor and Database (3PDb).},

  abstract = {While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] {$\geq$} 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.},

Specifically, in human activity recognition (HAR), IMU sensor data collected from human motion are categorically combined to formulate datasets that can be used for learning human activities. However, successful learning of human activities from motion data involves the design and use of proper feature representations of IMU sensor data and suitable classifiers. Furthermore, the scarcity of labelled data is an impeding factor in the process of understanding the performance capabilities of data-driven learning models. To tackle these challenges, two primary contributions are in this article: first; by using raw IMU sensor data, a spectrogram-based feature extraction approach is proposed. Second, an ensemble of data augmentations in feature space is proposed to take care of the data scarcity problem. Performance tests were conducted on a deep long term short term memory (LSTM) neural network architecture to explore the influence of feature representations and the augmentations on activity recognition accuracy. The proposed feature extraction approach combined with the data augmentation ensemble produces state-of-the-art accuracy results in HAR. A performance evaluation of each augmentation approach is performed to show the influence on classification accuracy. Finally, in addition to using our own dataset, the proposed data augmentation technique is evaluated against the University of California, Irvine (UCI) public online HAR dataset and yields state-of-the-art accuracy results at various learning rates.},

While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. This includes rotationally invariant energy predictions and a smooth, differentiable potential energy surface. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.},

  abstract = {Oral administration of protein drugs has always been challenging owing to various intestinal barriers. Herein, we developed an efficient oral protein delivery strategy by using in situ polymerization of zwitterions to encapsulate proteins, which were then loaded into enteric coated capsules for oral feeding. After oral administration of such capsules, the enteric coating would be degraded once the capsule enters the intestine, releasing polyzwitterion/protein nanocomplexes. With the help of polyzwitterion modification, such nanocomplexes were able to pass through the mucus and cellular barriers, likely by the proton-assisted amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) pathway. Such a polyzwitterion-based protein encapsulation strategy could allow for effective oral delivery of different proteins, including bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, and antibodies. Using this strategy, the oral bioavailabilities of insulin and immunoglobin G (IgG) were measured to be as high as 16.9\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Notably, oral feeding of polyzwitterion/insulin capsules could effectively lower the blood glucose level of diabetic animals (mice, rats, and pigs). Moreover, polyzwitterion/antiprogramed death-1 ({$\alpha$}PD-1) capsules were able to induce efficient antitumor immune responses, showing significant tumor inhibition effects toward B16F10- and 4T1-tumor bearing mouse models after oral administration. No significant toxic effect was observed for such oral protein formulations in the treated animals. Our work presents a strategy for the efficient oral delivery of protein drugs, including those with large molecular weights (e.g., antibodies) that can hardly be orally delivered using existing technologies.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we propose a new set of descriptors that, along with a few structural features of nanoporous materials, can be used by machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions of the gas uptake capacities of these materials. All new descriptors closely resemble the helium atom void fraction of the material framework. However, instead of a helium atom, a particle with an appropriately defined van der Waals radius is used. The set of void fractions of a small number of these particles is found to be sufficient to characterize uniquely the structure of each material and to account for the most important topological features. We assess the accuracy of our approach by examining the predictions of the random forest algorithm in the relative small dataset of the computation-ready, experimental (CoRE) MOFs (4700 structures) that have been experimentally synthesized and whose geometrical/structural features have been accurately calculated before. We first performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to accurately determine their methane uptake capacities at two different temperatures (280 and 298 K) and three different pressures (1, 5.8, and 65 bar). Despite the high chemical and structural diversity of the CoRE MOFs, it was found that the use of the proposed descriptors significantly improves the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm, particularly at low pressures, compared to the predictions made based solely on the rest structural features. More importantly, the algorithm can be easily adapted for other types of nanoporous materials beyond MOFs. Convergence of the predictions was reached even for small training set sizes compared to what was found in previous works using the hypothetical MOF database.},

A standard solution is to train networks with Quantization Aware Training [1], where the weights are quantized during training and the gradients approximated with the Straight-Through Estimator [2]. In this paper, we extend this approach to work with extreme compression methods where the approximations introduced by STE are severe. Our proposal is to only quantize a different random subset of weights during each forward, allowing for unbiased gradients to flow through the other weights. Controlling the amount of noise and its form allows for extreme compression rates while maintaining the performance of the original model. As a result we establish new state-of-the-art compromises between accuracy and model size both in natural language processing and image classification. For example, applying our method to state-of-the-art Transformer and ConvNet architectures, we can achieve 82.5\% accuracy on MNLI by compressing RoBERTa to 14 MB and 80.0\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by compressing an EfficientNet-B3 to 3.3 MB.},

Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems{\textemdash}from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\,{\texttimes}\,4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor's algorithm improves on Strassen's two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor's ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},

This class of architecture encompasses Mixture-of-Experts, Switch Transformers, Routing Networks, BASE layers, and others, all with the unifying idea that each example is acted on by a subset of the parameters. By doing so, the degree of sparsity decouples the parameter count from the compute per example allowing for extremely large, but efficient models. The resulting models have demonstrated significant improvements across diverse domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

Specifically, 78\% of the drugs associated with new patents were not new drugs, but existing ones, and extending protection is particularly pronounced among blockbuster drugs. Once companies start down the road of extending protection, they show a tendency to return to the well, with the majority adding more than one extension and 50\% becoming serial offenders. The problem is growing across time.},

The theory describes coil-globule transition for a given protein sequence when temperature is varied and has been benchmarked against the all-atom Monte Carlo simulation (using CAMPARI) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In addition, the model quantitatively shows how subtle alterations of charge placement in the primary sequence{\textemdash}while maintaining the same charge composition{\textemdash}can lead to significant changes in conformation, even as drastic as a coil (swelled above a purely random coil) to globule (collapsed below a random coil) and vice versa. The theory provides insights on how to control (enhance or suppress) these changes by tuning the temperature (or solution condition) and charge decoration. As an application, we predict the distribution of conformations (at room temperature) of all naturally occurring IDPs in the DisProt database and notice significant size variation even among IDPs with a similar composition of positive and negative charges. Based on this, we provide a new diagram-of-states delineating the sequence-conformation relation for proteins in the DisProt database. Next, we study the effect of post-translational modification, e.g., phosphorylation, on IDP conformations. Modifications as little as two-site phosphorylation can significantly alter the size of an IDP with everything else being constant (temperature, salt concentration, etc.). However, not all possible modification sites have the same effect on protein conformations; there are certain ``hot spots'' that can cause maximal change in conformation. The location of these ``hot spots'' in the parent sequence can readily be identified by using a sequence charge decoration metric originally introduced by Sawle and Ghosh. The ability of our model to predict conformations (both expanded and collapsed states) of IDPs at a high-throughput level can provide valuable insights into the different mechanisms by which phosphorylation/charge mutation controls IDP function.},

  abstract = {A statistical mechanical treatment of high polymer solutions has been carried out on the basis of an idealized model, originally proposed by Meyer, which is analogous to the one ordinarily assumed in the derivation of the ``ideal'' solution laws for molecules of equal size. There is obtained for the entropy of mixing of n solvent and N linear polymer molecules (originally disoriented), {$\Delta$}S=-k[(n/{$\beta$}) ln v1+N ln v2] where v1 and v2 are volume fractions and {$\beta$} is the number of solvent molecules replaceable by a freely orienting segment of the polymer chain. This expression is similar in form to the classical expression for equal-sized molecules, mole fractions having been replaced by volume fractions. When the disparity between the sizes of the two components is great, this expression gives entropies differing widely from the classical values, which accounts for the large deviations of high polymer solutions from ``ideal'' behavior. The entropy of disorientation of a perfectly arranged linear polymer is found to be of the order of R cal. per chain segment. After introducing a suitable heat of mixing term, partial molal free energies are computed, and the calculations are compared with experimental data for all concentrations. Phase equilibria have been calculated in the region of partial miscibility. The theory predicts, in agreement with experiment, that the critical composition for partial miscibility lies at a low concentration of polymer. Low intrinsic viscosities of polymers dissolved in poor solvents are attributed to the tendency for the molecule to assume a more compact configuration in such an environment.},

We focus our inquiry on three areas of interest in viral packing: the evolving structure of the packaged DNA condensate; the packing velocity; and the internal buildup of energy and resultant forces. Each of these areas has been studied experimentally, and we find that we can qualitatively reproduce experimental results. However, our findings also suggest that the phage genome packing process is fundamentally different than that suggested by the inverse spool model. We suggest that packing in general does not proceed in the deterministic fashion of the inverse-spool model, but rather is stochastic in character. As the chain configuration becomes compressed within the capsid, the structure, energy, and packing velocity all become dependent upon polymer dynamics. That many observed features of the packing process are rooted in condensed-phase polymer dynamics suggests that statistical mechanics, rather than mechanics, should serve as the proper theoretical basis for genome packing. Finally we suggest that, as a result of an internal protein unique to bacteriophage T7, the T7 genome may be significantly more ordered than is true for bacteriophage in general. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

The simulated trajectory of the DNA through the nanopores was calculated using Langevin dynamics. We present the results based on more than 120 000 individual translocations. We are particularly interested in this work in probing the physical basis of various experimentally observed-yet poorly understood-phenomena. Notably, we observe in our simulations the formation of ds-DNA hairpins, widely suspected to be the basis for quantized blockage. We study the translocation time, a measurable quantity crucially important in polyelectrolyte characterization, as a function of hairpin vertex location along the polymer backbone, finding that this behavior can be tuned to some degree by simulation parameters. We also study the voltage dependence of the tendency of hairpins to serve as the initiators of translocation events. Surprisingly, we find that the resulting probability depends vitally upon whether the events counted are ultimately successful or not. Further details lead us to propose that failed attempts in experimental translocation studies may be more common-and deceptive-than is generally recognized. We find the time taken by successful single file translocations to be directly proportional to the ratio of chain length to the applied voltage. Finally, we address a common yet puzzling phenomenon in translocation experiments: translocation events in which the current through the pore is highly, yet incompletely, blocked. We present the findings that offer a new explanation for such events. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. We find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the "lottery ticket hypothesis:" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. We present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20\% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.},

Although previous work has typically focused on its normalization component, BatchNorm also adds two per-feature trainable parameters: a coefficient and a bias. However, the role and expressive power of these parameters remains unclear. To study this question, we investigate the performance achieved when training only these parameters and freezing all others at their random initializations. We find that doing so leads to surprisingly high performance. For example, a sufficiently deep ResNet reaches 83\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 in this configuration. Interestingly, BatchNorm achieves this performance in part by naturally learning to disable around a third of the random features without any changes to the training objective. Not only do these results highlight the under-appreciated role of the affine parameters in BatchNorm, but{\textemdash}in a broader sense{\textemdash}they characterize the expressive power of neural networks constructed simply by shifting and rescaling random features.},

We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in {$\mathbb{R}$}n. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm.

Here, we investigate neural scaling behavior in large chemical models by varying model and dataset sizes over many orders of magnitude, studying models with over one billion parameters, pre-trained on datasets of up to ten million datapoints. We consider large language models for generative chemistry and graph neural networks for machine-learned interatomic potentials. To enable large-scale scientific deep learning studies under resource constraints, we develop the Training Performance Estimation (TPE) framework to reduce the costs of scalable hyperparameter optimization by up to 90\%. Using this framework, we discover empirical neural scaling relations for deep chemical models and investigate the interplay between physical priors and scale. Potential applications of large, pre-trained models for "prompt engineering" and unsupervised representation learning of molecules are shown.},

  abstract = {Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are negatively charged molecules covering the surface of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Adding divalent cations (DCs) is important to stabilize the LPS bilayer. Thus, DCs are always only considered as membrane stabilizing ions. Here, on the basis of a coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field, we conduct molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to study the divalent cation mediated LPS interaction and the stability of the LPS membrane in a wide range of DC concentrations. By measuring the LPS binding free energy and the LPS{\textendash}LPS aggregate from the association course between two LPS molecules, we find that the initial addition of DCs may significantly facilitate the aggregation of LPSs into a compact structure, while sequentially adding more DCs only unpacks the LPS aggregate and drives the dissolution of LPSs. With an increasing concentration of DCs, we find a gradual replacement of DCs to monovalent cations as condensed counterions on the LPS, which follows a sign~change from negative to positive in terms of the LPS effective charge and a switch of LPSs in solution from undergoing precipitation to resolubilization on adding DCs. This interaction change in the level of two LPSs accounts for the structure variation of the LPS assembly on a larger scale, where the LPS packing rigidity in the assembly bilayer is found with a similar nonmonotonic dependence with the DC concentration. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of a re-entrant condensation behavior for LPS molecules, which can be exploited for developing novel membrane-perturbing agents based on multivalent ions as efficient GNB antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Driving forces for association between oppositely charged biological or synthetic polymers in aqueous solution have long been identified as electrostatic in origin. This attraction is broken down into an entropic component, due to loss of counterions, and an enthalpic component, stemming from Coulombic attraction between opposite charges. While the balance between entropic and enthalpic contributions shifts according to the conditions, the presence of exotherms or endotherms on mixing, though small, are viewed as signatures of Coulombic interactions which support theories of polyelectrolyte association rooted in continuum electrostatics. Here, a head-to-head comparison is made between mechanisms based on electrostatics and those based on specific ion pairing, or ion exchange. Using a Hofmeister series of counterions for a common polycation, poly(diallyldimethylammonium), enthalpy changes on association with poly(styrenesulfonate) are shown to derive from changes in water perturbation, revealed by Raman scattering studies of water O{\textendash}H vibrations.

Yet in the research reported here, we showed that Arabic speakers tend to conceptualize the future as behind and the past as ahead of them, despite using spoken metaphors that suggest the opposite. We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

Achieving dramatically reduced cost with enhanced throughput and quality will require the seamless integration of scientific and technological effort across disciplines within biochemistry, chemistry, physics and engineering. The challenges include sample preparation, surface chemistry, fluorescent labels, optimizing the enzyme-substrate system, optics, instrumentation, understanding tradeoffs of throughput versus accuracy, and read-length/phasing limitations.

  abstract = {The characterization of the mechanical properties of crystalline materials is nowadays considered a routine computational task in DFT calculations. However, its high computational cost still prevents it from being used in high-throughput screening methodologies, where a cheaper estimate of the elastic properties of a material is required. In this work, we have investigated the accuracy of force field calculations for the prediction of mechanical properties and, in particular, for the characterization of the directional Poisson's ratio. We analyze the behavior of about 600 000 hypothetical zeolitic structures at the classical level (a scale 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous studies), to highlight generic trends between mechanical properties and energetic stability. By comparing these results with DFT calculations on 991 zeolitic frameworks, we highlight the limitations of force field predictions, in particular for predicting auxeticity. We then used this reference DFT data as a training set for a machine learning algorithm, showing that it offers a way to build fast and reliable predictive models for anisotropic properties. The accuracies obtained are, in particular, much better than the current "cheap" approach for screening, which is the use of force fields. These results are a significant improvement over the previous work, due to the more difficult nature of the properties studied, namely, the anisotropic elastic response. It is also the first time such a large training data set is used for zeolitic materials.},

  abstract = {Proteins and nucleic acids can phase-separate in the cell to form concentrated biomolecular condensates1{\textendash}4. The functions of condensates~span many length scales: they modulate interactions and chemical reactions at the molecular scale5, organize biochemical processes at the mesoscale6 and compartmentalize cells4. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these processes~will require detailed knowledge of the rich dynamics across these scales7. The mesoscopic dynamics of biomolecular condensates have been extensively characterized8, but their behaviour at the molecular scale has remained more elusive. Here, as an example of biomolecular phase separation, we study complex~coacervates of two highly and oppositely charged disordered human proteins9. Their dense phase is 1,000 times more concentrated than the dilute phase, and the resulting percolated interaction network10 leads to a bulk viscosity 300 times greater than that of water. However, single-molecule spectroscopy optimized for measurements within individual droplets reveals that at the molecular scale, the disordered proteins remain exceedingly dynamic, with their chain configurations interconverting on submicrosecond timescales. Massive all-atom molecular~dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental observations and explain this apparent discrepancy: the underlying interactions between individual charged side chains are short-lived and exchange on a pico- to nanosecond timescale. Our results indicate that, despite the high macroscopic viscosity of phase-separated systems, local biomolecular rearrangements required for efficient reactions at the molecular scale can remain rapid.},

Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval.},

Although passive and active targeted-drug delivery has addressed a number of important issues, additional properties that can be included in nanocarrier systems to enhance the bioavailability of drugs at the disease site, and especially upon cellular internalization, are very important. A nanocarrier system incorporated with stimuli-responsive property (e.g., pH, temperature, or redox potential), for instance, would be amenable to address some of the systemic and intracellular delivery barriers. In this review, we discuss the role of stimuli-responsive nanocarrier systems for drug and gene delivery. The advancement in material science has led to design of a variety of materials, which are used for development of nanocarrier systems that can respond to biological stimuli. Temperature, pH, and hypoxia are examples of ``triggers'' at the diseased site that could be exploited with stimuli-responsive nanocarriers. With greater understanding of the difference between normal and pathological tissues and cells and parallel developments in material design, there is a highly promising role of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for drug and gene delivery in the future.},

We develop an optimization-based method to analyze large organic chemical reaction networks and design overlapping synthesis plans for entire molecule libraries so as to minimize the overall number of unique chemical compounds needed as either starting materials or reaction conditions. We consider multiple objectives, including the number of starting materials, the number of catalysts/solvents/reagents, and the likelihood of success of the overall syntheses plan, to select an optimal reaction network to access the target molecules. The library synthesis planning task was formulated as a network flow optimization problem, and we design an efficient decomposition scheme that reduces solution time by a factor of 5 and scales to instance with 48 target molecules and nearly 8000 intermediate reactions within hours. In four case studies of pharmaceutical compounds, the approach reduces the number of starting materials and catalysts/solvents/reagents needed by 32.2 and 66.0\% on average and up to 63.2 and 80.0\% in the best cases.

  abstract = {Molecular optimization is a fundamental goal in the chemical sciences and is of central interest to drug and material design. In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various aspects of computational molecular optimizations, emphasizing high validity, diversity, and, most recently, synthesizability. Despite this progress, many papers report results on trivial or self-designed tasks, bringing additional challenges to directly assessing the performance of new methods. Moreover, the sample efficiency of the optimization--the number of molecules evaluated by the oracle--is rarely discussed, despite being an essential consideration for realistic discovery applications. To fill this gap, we have created an open-source benchmark for practical molecular optimization, PMO, to facilitate the transparent and reproducible evaluation of algorithmic advances in molecular optimization. This paper thoroughly investigates the performance of 25 molecular design algorithms on 23 tasks with a particular focus on sample efficiency. Our results show that most "state-of-the-art" methods fail to outperform their predecessors under a limited oracle budget allowing 10K queries and that no existing algorithm can efficiently solve certain molecular optimization problems in this setting. We analyze the influence of the optimization algorithm choices, molecular assembly strategies, and oracle landscapes on the optimization performance to inform future algorithm development and benchmarking. PMO provides a standardized experimental setup to comprehensively evaluate and compare new molecule optimization methods with existing ones.

  abstract = {The discovery of functional molecules is an expensive and time-consuming process, exemplified by the rising costs of small molecule therapeutic discovery. One class of techniques of growing interest for early-stage drug discovery is de novo molecular generation and optimization, catalyzed by the development of new deep learning approaches. These techniques can suggest novel molecular structures intended to maximize a multi-objective function, e.g., suitability as a therapeutic against a particular target, without relying on brute-force exploration of a chemical space. However, the utility of these approaches is stymied by ignorance of synthesizability. To highlight the severity of this issue, we use a data-driven computer-aided synthesis planning program to quantify how often molecules proposed by state-of-the-art generative models cannot be readily synthesized. Our analysis demonstrates that there are several tasks for which these models generate unrealistic molecular structures despite performing well on popular quantitative benchmarks. Synthetic complexity heuristics can successfully bias generation toward synthetically-tractable chemical space, although doing so necessarily detracts from the primary objective. This analysis suggests that to improve the utility of these models in real discovery workflows, new algorithm development is warranted.},

For example, DNA packing in viruses involves confining the viral genome in a volume (the viral capsid) with dimensions that are comparable to the DNA persistence length. Similarly, eukaryotic DNA is packed in DNA{\textendash}protein complexes (nucleosomes), in which DNA is tightly bent around protein spools. DNA is also tightly bent by many proteins that regulate transcription, resulting in a variation in gene expression that is amenable to quantitative analysis. In these cases, DNA loops are formed with lengths that are comparable to or smaller than the DNA persistence length.

Exist- ing epigenetic studies omit unassembled and unmappable genomic regions (e.g. centromeres, pericen- tromeres, acrocentric chromosome arms, subtelomeres, segmental duplications, tandem repeats). Le- veraging the new assembly, we were able to measure enrichment of epigenetic marks with short reads using k-mer assisted mapping methods. This granted array-level enrichment information to character- ize the epigenetic regulation of these satellite repeats. Using nanopore sequencing data, we generated base level maps of the most complete human methylome ever produced. We examined methylation patterns in satellite DNA and revealed organized patterns of methylation along individual molecules. When exploring the centromeric epigenome, we discovered a distinctive dip in centromere methylation consistent with active sites of kinetochore assembly. Through long-read chromatin accessibility mea- surements (nanoNOMe) paired to CUT\&RUN data, we found the hypomethylated region was extremely inaccessible and paired to CENP-A/B binding. With long-reads we interrogated allele-specific, long- range epigenetic patterns in complex macro-satellite arrays such as those involved in X chromosome inactivation. Using the single molecule measurements we can clustered reads based on methylation status alone distinguishing epigenetically heterogeneous and homogeneous areas. The analysis pro- vides a framework to investigate the most elusive regions of the human genome, applying both long and short-read technology to grant new insights into epigenetic regulation.},

Based on a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome (T2T-CHM13), we present the first comprehensive view of human SD organization. SDs account for nearly one-third of the additional sequence increasing the genome-wide estimate from 5.4\% to 7.0\% (218 Mbp). An analysis of 266 human genomes shows that 91\% of the new T2T-CHM13 SD sequence (68.3 Mbp) better represents human copy number. We find that SDs show increased single- nucleotide variation diversity when compared to unique regions; we characterize methylation signatures that correlate with duplicate gene transcription and predict 182 novel protein-coding gene candidates. We find that 63\% (35.11/55.7 Mbp) of acrocentric chromosomes consist of SDs distinct from rDNA and satellite sequences. Acrocentric SDs are 1.75-fold longer (p=0.00034) than other SDs, are frequently shared with autosomal pericentromeric regions, and are heteromorphic among human chromosomes. Comparing long-read assemblies from other human (n=12) and nonhuman primate (n=5) genomes, we use the T2T-CHM13 genome to systematically reconstruct the evolution and structural haplotype diversity of biomedically relevant (LPA, SMN) and duplicated genes (TBC1D3, SRGAP2C, ARHGAP11B) important in the expansion of the human frontal cortex. The analysis reveals unprecedented patterns of structural heterozygosity and massive evolutionary differences in SD organization between humans and their closest living relatives.},

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams that are not a priori segmented into subsequences with explicitly marked ends at which the network's internal state could be reset. Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive "forget gate" that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves them, and in an elegant way.},

Of particular interest are regions of differential methylation between parental alleles, as these often dictate monoallelic gene expression, resulting in parent of origin specific control of the embryonic transcriptome and subsequent development, in a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we show that, with an average genomic coverage of {$\sim$}10, it is possible to determine both the level of methylation of CpG sites and the haplotype from which each read arises. The long-read property is exploited to characterize, using novel methods, both methylation and haplotype for reads that have reduced basecalling precision compared to Sanger sequencing. We validate the analysis both through comparison of nanopore-derived methylation patterns with those from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data and through comparison with previously reported data. Our analysis successfully identifies known imprinting control regions (ICRs) as well as some novel differentially methylated regions which, due to their proximity to hitherto unknown monoallelically expressed genes, may represent new ICRs.},

  abstract = {Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.},

Controlled chain growth polymerization techniques have brought this goal closer, allowing the preparation of multiblock copolymers with ordered sequences of functional monomers. Such structures have promising applications ranging from medicine to materials engineering. Here we show, however, that the statistical nature of chain growth polymerization places strong limits on the control that can be obtained. We demonstrate that monomer locations are distributed according to surprisingly simple laws related to the Poisson or beta distributions. The degree of control is quantified in terms of the yield of the desired structure and the standard deviation of the appropriate distribution, allowing comparison between different synthetic techniques. This analysis establishes experimental requirements for the design of polymeric chains with controlled sequence of functionalities, which balance precise control of structure with simplicity of synthesis.},

Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including QSAR, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network based models often exceeded the "glass ceiling" expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry.},

This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in the set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.},

The effective quality of the solvent is found to depend on the interplay between polymer grafting density, acid-base equilibrium, and salt concentration. Our results reveal that increasing salt concentration results in a thermodynamically more stable layer. This reverse salt effect is due to the competition between the solvent quality and the dual role of the ionic strength in screening the electrostatic interactions (reducing stability with increasing salt concentration), and regulating the charge on the polymer (increasing charge with increasing salt concentration). Grafted weak polyelectrolyte layers are found to be thermodynamically unstable at intermediate surface coverages. Additionally, it is established that the increased solubility of the layer at low surface coverage is due to the relatively large charge of the grafted polymers. The range of stability of the film with regard to polymer surface coverage, temperature, bulk pH and salt concentration is demonstrated.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

  abstract = {It is a truth universally acknowledged that faster catalysts enable the more efficient transformation of molecules to useful products and enhance the sustainable utilization of natural resources. However, the limit of static catalyst performance defined by the Sabatier principle has motivated a new approach to dynamic catalyst design, whereby catalysts oscillate with time between varying energetic states at sufficiently high resonant frequencies to overcome the Sabatier `volcano peak'. In this work, the concept of dynamic catalytic resonance was experimentally demonstrated via the electro-catalytic oxidation of formic acid in water on a Pt working electrode within a semi-continuous multi-phase flow reactor. Steady-state electro-oxidation of formic acid at 0.6 V (NHE) exhibited a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of CO2 formation of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.0 s-1 at room temperature. However, oscillation of the electrodynamic potential between 0.8 V and open circuit via a square waveform at varying frequency (10-3 {$<$} f {$<$} 103 Hz) increased the optimal TOF to \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 s-1 at 0.5 Hz. An even higher TOF of \${\textbackslash}sim\$20 s-1 was observed at a resonant frequency of 100 Hz for a square waveform oscillating between zero and 0.8 V. The rate increase in formic acid electro-oxidation via catalytic resonance of more than an order of magnitude (20x) above potentiostatic conditions was interpreted to occur by non-faradaic formic acid dehydration to surface-bound carbon monoxide at low potentials, followed by surface oxidation and desorption to carbon dioxide at high potentials.},

  abstract = {Biological systems exhibit complex behaviours that emerge at many different levels of or-ganization. These span the regulation of gene expression within single cells to the use of quorum sensing to co-ordinate the action of entire bacterial colonies. Synthetic biology aims to make the engineering of biology easier, offering an opportunity to control natural systems and develop new synthetic systems with useful prescribed behaviours. However, in many cases, it is not understood how individual cells should be programmed to ensure the emer-gence of a required collective behaviour. Agent-based modelling aims to tackle this problem, offering a framework in which to simulate such systems and explore cellular design rules. In this article, I review the use of agent-based models in synthetic biology, outline the available computational tools, and provide details on recently engineered biological systems that are amenable to this approach. I further highlight the challenges facing this methodology and some of the potential future directions.},

Through biochemical and molecular analysis of clinical material, we find that drug resistance is associated with the reactivation of BCR-ABL signal transduction in all cases examined. In six of nine patients, resistance was associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain known to form a critical hydrogen bond with the drug. This substitution of threonine with isoleucine was sufficient to confer STI-571 resistance in a reconstitution experiment. In three patients, resistance was associated with progressive BCR-ABL gene amplification. These studies provide evidence that genetically complex cancers retain dependence on an initial oncogenic event and suggest a strategy for identifying inhibitors of STI-571 resistance.},

  abstract = {High-throughput virtual screening is an indispensable technique utilized in the discovery of small molecules. In cases where the library of molecules is exceedingly large, the cost of an exhaustive virtual screen may be prohibitive. Model-guided optimization has been employed to lower these costs through dramatic increases in sample efficiency compared to random selection. However, these techniques introduce new costs to the workflow through the surrogate model training and inference steps. In this study, we propose an extension to the framework of model-guided optimization that mitigates inferences costs using a technique we refer to as design space pruning (DSP), which irreversibly removes poor-performing candidates from consideration. We study the application of DSP to a variety of optimization tasks and observe significant reductions in overhead costs while exhibiting similar performance to the baseline optimization. DSP represents an attractive extension of model-guided optimization that can limit overhead costs in optimization settings where these costs are non-negligible relative to objective costs, such as docking.},

Reaction prediction based on high-level quantum chemical methods is complex 3, even for simple molecules. Although machine learning is powerful for data analysis 4,5, its applications in chemistry are still being developed 6 . Inspired by strategies based on chemists' intuition 7, we propose that a reaction system controlled by a machine learning algorithm may be able to explore the space of chemical reactions quickly, especially if trained by an expert 8 . Here we present an organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical reactions and analysis faster than they can be performed manually, as well as predict the reactivity of possible reagent combinations after conducting a small number of experiments, thus effectively navigating chemical reaction space. By using machine learning for decision making, enabled by binary encoding of the chemical inputs, the reactions can be assessed in real time using nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning system was able to predict the reactivity of about 1,000 reaction combinations with accuracy greater than 80 per cent after considering the outcomes of slightly over 10 per cent of the dataset. This approach was also used to calculate the reactivity of published datasets. Further, by using real-time data from our robot, these predictions were followed up manually by a chemist, leading to the discovery of four reactions.},

However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label un-segmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems.

  abstract = {The automated construction of coarse-grained models represents a pivotal component in computer simulation of physical systems and is a key enabler in various analysis and design tasks related to uncertainty quantification. Pertinent methods are severely inhibited by the high-dimension of the parametric input and the limited number of training input/output pairs that can be generated when computationally demanding forward models are considered. Such cases are frequently encountered in the modeling of random heterogeneous media where the scale of the microstructure necessitates the use of high-dimensional random vectors and very fine discretizations of the governing equations. The present paper proposes a probabilistic Machine Learning framework that is capable of operating in the presence of Small Data by exploiting aspects of the physical structure of the problem as well as contextual knowledge. As a result, it can perform comparably well under extrapolative conditions. It unifies the tasks of dimensionality and model-order reduction through an encoder-decoder scheme that simultaneously identifies a sparse set of salient lower-dimensional microstructural features and calibrates an inexpensive, coarse-grained model which is predictive of the output. Information loss is accounted for and quantified in the form of probabilistic predictive estimates. The learning engine is based on Stochastic Variational Inference. We demonstrate how the variational objectives can be used not only to train the coarse-grained model, but also to suggest refinements that lead to improved predictions.},

Gating mechanisms that use softly saturating activation functions to emulate the discrete switching of digital logic circuits are good examples of this. We propose to exploit the injection of appropriate noise so that the gradients may flow easily, even if the noiseless application of the activation function would yield zero gradients. Large noise will dominate the noise-free gradient and allow stochastic gradient descent to explore more. By adding noise only to the problematic parts of the activation function, we allow the optimization procedure to explore the boundary between the degenerate (saturating) and the well-behaved parts of the activation function. We also establish connections to simulated annealing, when the amount of noise is annealed down, making it easier to optimize hard objective functions. We find experimentally that replacing such saturating activation functions by noisy variants helps optimization in many contexts, yielding state-of-the-art or competitive results on different datasets and task, especially when training seems to be the most difficult, e.g., when curriculum learning is necessary to obtain good results.},

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the phase separation behaviors of the Mfps are still not fully understood. Here, we report that GK-16*, a peptide derived from the primary adhesive protein Mfp-5, forms coacervate in seawater conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with point mutation experiments demonstrate that Dopa- and Gly- mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions are essential in the coacervation process. The properties of GK-16* coacervates could be controlled by tuning the strength of the electrostatic and Dopa-mediated hydrogen bond interactions via controlling the pH and salt concentration of the solution. The GK-16* coacervate undergoes a pH induced liquid-to-gel transition, which can be utilized for the underwater delivery and curing of the adhesives. Our study provides useful molecular design principles for the development of mussel-inspired peptidyl coacervate adhesives with tunable properties.},

It can directly estimate the probabilistic accuracy bound by minimizing the maximum probability of misclassification. The structural information of data is an effective way to represent prior knowledge, and has been found to be vital for designing classifiers in real-world problems. However, MPM only considers the prior probability distribution of each class with a given mean and covariance matrix, which does not efficiently exploit the structural information of data. In this paper, we use two finite mixture models to capture the structural information of the data from binary classification. For each subdistribution in a finite mixture model, only its mean and covariance matrix are assumed to be known. Based on the finite mixture models, we propose a structural MPM (SMPM). SMPM can be solved effectively by a sequence of the second-order cone programming problems. Moreover, we extend a linear model of SMPM to a nonlinear model by exploiting kernelization techniques. We also show that the SMPM can be interpreted as a large margin classifier and can be transformed to support vector machine and maxi-min margin machine under certain special conditions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of SMPM.},

Understanding quantitatively the effects of active layer nanostructure on charge carrier transport in NP-assembly-based OPV devices is crucial in order to optimize device performance. Toward this end, in this study, we report results of numerical simulations of electron and hole transport in OPV devices with active layers consisting of P3HT:PCBM nanoparticle assemblies based on deterministic charge carrier transport models. The models account for the dynamics of bounded electron-hole pairs and free charge carriers, as well as trapped charge carrier kinetics, self-consistently with the electric field distribution in the device active layer. The models reproduce both transient photocurrents from time-of-flight (TOF) experiments and steady-state photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) device characteristics from experimental measurements under steady illumination. The simulation results provide quantitative interpretations to the active layer nanostructure effects on charge transport and device power conversion efficiency (PCE). The models also predict improved device PCE by introducing proper interlayers between the active layer and the electrodes and controlling the thickness of the active layer.},

To address this limitation, we introduce ``deep compression'', a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35{\texttimes} to 49{\texttimes} without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9{\texttimes} to 13{\texttimes}; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35{\texttimes}, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49{\texttimes} from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3{\texttimes} to 4{\texttimes} layerwise speedup and 3{\texttimes} to 7{\texttimes} better energy efficiency.},

  abstract = {The parametrization and validation of the OPLS3 force field for small molecules and proteins are reported. Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS\_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across perform-ance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein-ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30\% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.},

Turbidimetric pH titration was used to compare the response of different charge-balanced coacervates to changes in pH. At high molecular weight, resistance to stimuli such as ionic strength and pH increased from the liquid self-coacervate formed from the stoichiometric PA, through complex coacervates formed from complementary nonstoichiometric PAs, to less hydrated coacervates or precipitates formed from two PE homopolymers. In addition, optical microscopy was used to map the compositional regions as a function of ionic strength corresponding to liquid{\textendash}liquid phase separation by both self- and complex coacervation and liquid{\textendash}solid phase separation or precipitation. Coacervates were thermally responsive and showed lower critical solution temperatures that were sensitive to composition and ionic strength. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to explore the energetics of complexation for select complex coacervates, confirming that complexation is dominated by an entropic contribution. Coacervate droplets were shown to reversibly bind ionic dyes and thus have potential use as drug release systems. The coacervate droplets also reacted with genipin to form cross-linked coacervate microgels. The synthetic coacervates used here are easily accessible by free-radical copolymerization and can serve as model systems for phase separation of natural polyampholytes.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers{\textemdash}8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

We assessed the quality of each descriptor by machine-learning the molar energy and volume for each hypothetical framework in the dataset. We have found that a SOAP representation with a cutoff length of 6 {\textbackslash}AA, which goes beyond near-neighbor tetrahedra, best describes the structural diversity in the Deem database by capturing relevant interatomic correlations. Kernel principal component analysis shows that SOAP maintains its superior performance even when reducing its dimensionality to those of the classical descriptors and that the first three kernel principal components capture the main variability in the dataset, allowing a 3D point cloud visualization of local environments in the Deem database. This "cloud atlas" of local environments was found to show good correlations with the contribution of a given motif to the density and stability of its parent framework. Local volume and energy maps constructed from the SOAP/machine learning analyses provide new images of zeolites that reveal smooth variations of local volumes and energies across a given framework and correlations between the contributions to volume and energy associated with each atom-centered environment.},

Even though millions of distinct siliceous networks can be generated by computer-aided searches, no new hypothetical framework has yet been synthesized. The needle-in-a-haystack problem of finding promising candidates among large databases of predicted structures has intrigued materials scientists for decades; most work to date on the zeolite problem has been limited to intuitive structural descriptors. Here, we tackle this problem through a rigorous data science scheme-the "zeolite sorting hat"-that exploits interatomic correlations to produce a 95\% real versus theoretical zeolites classification accuracy. The hypothetical frameworks that are grouped together with known zeolites are promising candidates for synthesis, that can be further ranked by estimating their thermodynamic stability. A critical analysis of the classifier reveals the decisive structural features. Further partitioning into compositional classes provides guidance in the design of synthetic strategies.},

For pores {$<$}3.0 nm diameter, we find a threshold for permeation of double-stranded DNA that depends on the electric field and pH. For a 2 nm diameter pore, the electric field threshold is {$\sim$}3.1 V/10 nm at pH = 8.5; the threshold decreases as pH becomes more acidic or the diameter increases. Molecular dynamics indicates that the field threshold originates from a stretching transition in DNA that occurs under the force gradient in a nanopore. Lowering pH destabilizes the double helix, facilitating DNA translocation at lower fields. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

Among them is oxDNA, a coarse-grained, sequence-specific model that captures the hybridisation transition of DNA and many structural properties of single- and double-stranded DNA. oxDNA was previously only available as standalone software, but has now been implemented into the popular LAMMPS molecular dynamics code. This article describes the new implementation and analyses its parallel performance. Practical applications are presented that focus on single-stranded DNA, an area of research which has been so far under-investigated. The LAMMPS implementation of oxDNA lowers the entry barrier for using the oxDNA model significantly, facilitates future code development and interfacing with existing LAMMPS functionality as well as other coarse-grained and atomistic DNA models.

This requirement is ``artificial'' and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, ``spatial pyramid pooling'', to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102{\^A} faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank \#2 in object detection and \#3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition.},

It is widely believed that growing training sets and models should improve accuracy and result in better products. As DL application domains grow, we would like a deeper understanding of the relationships between training set size, computational scale, and model accuracy improvements to advance the state-of-the-art. This paper presents a large scale empirical characterization of generalization error and model size growth as training sets grow. We introduce a methodology for this measurement and test four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. Our empirical results show power-law generalization error scaling across a breadth of factors, resulting in power-law exponents{\textemdash}the "steepness" of the learning curve{\textemdash}yet to be explained by theoretical work. Further, model improvements only shift the error but do not appear to affect the power-law exponent. We also show that model size scales sublinearly with data size. These scaling relationships have significant implications on deep learning research, practice, and systems. They can assist model debugging, setting accuracy targets, and decisions about data set growth. They can also guide computing system design and underscore the importance of continued computational scaling.},

  abstract = {An autoencoder network uses a set of recognition weights to convert an  input vector into a code vector.  It then uses a set of generative weights to  convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input  vector.  We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based  on the  Minimum  Description Length  (MDL)  principle.  The aim  is  to  minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and  the reconstruction error.  We  show  that this information  is  minimized  by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distri(cid:173) bution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible  code vector given  the input vector.  Unfortunately,  if the code vectors  use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute  this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors.  We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can  be used to  compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this ap(cid:173) proximation gives an upper bound on the description length.  Even when  this bound is poor,  it can  be used  as a  Lyapunov function for learning  both the generative and the recognition weights.  We  demonstrate that  this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is an important component of molecular property prediction, particularly for drug discovery applications where model predictions direct experimental design and where unanticipated imprecision wastes valuable time and resources. The need for UQ is especially acute for neural models, which are becoming increasingly standard yet are challenging to interpret. While several approaches to UQ have been proposed in the literature, there is no clear consensus on the comparative performance of these models. In this paper, we study this question in the context of regression tasks. We systematically evaluate several methods on five regression data sets using multiple complementary performance metrics. Our experiments show that none of the methods we tested is unequivocally superior to all others, and none produces a particularly reliable ranking of errors across multiple data sets. While we believe that these results show that existing UQ methods are not sufficient for all common use cases and further research is needed, we conclude with a practical recommendation as to which existing techniques seem to perform well relative to others.},

Here we present LookingGlass, a deep learning model encoding contextually-aware, functionally and evolutionarily relevant representations of short DNA reads, that distinguishes reads of disparate function, homology, and environmental origin. We demonstrate the ability of LookingGlass to be fine-tuned via transfer learning to perform a range of diverse tasks: to identify novel oxidoreductases, to predict enzyme optimal temperature, and to recognize the reading frames of DNA sequence fragments. LookingGlass enables functionally relevant representations of otherwise unknown and unannotated sequences, shedding light on the microbial dark matter that dominates life on Earth.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

A variation of this structure is one in which a particle size is obtained which establishes a point in the particulate system above or below which a predetermined fraction of the total mass exists. The preferred structure uses a threshold circuit responding to particle size and separating the electrical pulses produced by the particles being scanned in the Coulter apparatus through the use of such a threshold. The pulse trains are converted into current and these are compared, adjusting the threshold up and down until the desired relationship is reached in a comparison device. The level of the threshold being calibrated to particle size then represents the dividing size between the two fractions. One of the most useful pieces of information of this kind is the dividing size which is the mass median, in which the respective masses of particulate matter above and below the dividing size are equal to one another.},

The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention.

In the presence of multivalent counterions, attraction between charged DNA strands occurs. Increasing the concentration of multivalent ions leads to a decrease of the osmotic pressure, and a sufficiently high ion concentration results in the precipitation of the polymer. Replacing the monovalent counterions by hydrogen ions (decreasing the pH) also produces a marked decrease of the osmotic pressure, and at low pH a phase transition takes place. In this paper we analyze osmotic swelling pressure measurements and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements made on chemically cross-linked DNA gels swollen in near physiological salt solutions. The effect of calcium ions is compared with that of decreasing the pH of the equilibrium salt solution. We demonstrate that both the concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure and the SANS response of DNA gels display significant differences in the two cases.},

Parasitic energy is a new approach for material evaluation to address the energy load imposed on a power plant while applying CCS. In this work, we evaluate over 60 different materials with respect to their parasitic energy, including experimentally realized and hypothetical materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), porous polymer networks (PPNs), and zeolites. The results are compared to other proposed evaluation criteria and performance differences are studied regarding the regeneration modes, (i.e. Pressure-Swing (PSA) and Temperature-Swing Adsorption (TSA)) as well as the flue gas composition.},

  abstract = {The polymeric mucin MUC5B provides the structural and functional framework of respiratory mucus, conferring both viscoelastic and antimicrobial properties onto this vital protective barrier. Whilst it is established that MUC5B forms disulfide-linked linear polymers, how this relates to their packaging in secretory granules, and their molecular form in mucus remain to be fully elucidated. Moreover, the role of the central heavily O-glycosylated mucin domains in MUC5B conformation is incompletely described. Here we have completed a detailed structural analysis on native MUC5B polymers purified from saliva and subsequently investigated how MUC5B conformation is affected by changes in calcium concentration and pH, factors important for mucin intragranular packaging and post-secretory expansion. The results identify that MUC5B has a beaded structure repeating along the polymer axis and suggest that these repeating motifs arise from distinct glycosylation patterns. Moreover, we demonstrate that the conformation of these highly entangled linear polymers is sensitive to calcium concentration and changes in pH. In the presence of calcium (Ca2+, 10\,mM) at pH 5.0, MUC5B adopted a compact conformation which was lost either upon removal of calcium with EGTA, or by increasing the pH to 7.4. These results suggest a pathway of mucin collapse to enable intracellular packaging and mechanisms driving mucin expansion following secretion. They also point to the importance of the tight control of calcium and pH during different stages of mucin biosynthesis and secretion, and in the generation of correct mucus barrier properties.},

Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that-even in very high- dimensional cases-most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we demonstrate a tunneling nanogap technique to identify individual RNA nucleotides, which can be used as a mechanism to read the nucleobases for direct sequencing of RNA in a solid-state nanopore. The tunneling nanogap is composed of two electrodes separated by a distance of {$<$}3 nm and functionalized with a recognition molecule. When a chemical entity is captured in the gap, it generates electron tunneling currents, a process we call recognition tunneling (RT). Using RT nanogaps created in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we acquired the electron tunneling signals for the canonical and two modified RNA nucleotides. To call the individual RNA nucleotides from the RT data, we adopted a machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), for the data analysis. Through the SVM, we were able to identify the individual RNA nucleotides and distinguish them from their DNA counterparts with reasonably high accuracy. Since each RNA nucleoside contains a hydroxyl group at the 2{${'}$}-position of its sugar ring in an RNA strand, it allows for the formation of a tunneling junction at a larger nanogap compared to the DNA nucleoside in a DNA strand, which lacks the 2{${'}$} hydroxyl group. It also proves advantageous for the manufacture of RT devices. This study is a proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of an RT nanopore device for directly sequencing single RNA molecules, including those bearing modifications.},

In the present study, we combined solid-state nanopores-a single molecule sensor-with a support vector machine (SVM)-a machine learning algorithm for the analysis of GAGs. Our results indicate that the nanopore/SVM technique could distinguish between monodisperse fragments of heparin and chondroitin sulfate with high accuracy ({$>$}90\%), allowing as low as 0.8\% (w/w) of chondroitin sulfate impurities in a heparin sample to be detected. In addition, the nanopore/SVM technique distinguished between unfractionated heparin (UFH) and enoxaparin (low molecular weight heparin) with an accuracy of {$\sim$}94\% on average. With a reference sample for calibration, a nanopore could achieve nanomolar sensitivity and a 5-Log dynamic range. We were able to quantify heparin with reasonable accuracy using multiple nanopores.

In this work, we introduce a conditional generative model for protein sequences given 3D structures based on graph representations. Our approach efficiently captures the complex dependencies in proteins by focusing on those that are long-range in sequence but local in 3D space. This graph-based approach improves in both speed and reliability over conventional and other neural network-based approaches, and takes a step toward rapid and targeted biomolecular design with the aid of deep generative models.},

  abstract = {The assembly of long-chain polymers into an ordered state is a process that has puzzled polymer scientists for several decades. A process that is largely controlled by the strength of intermolecular attractions in small molecular systems, this crystallization in the case of polymers is controlled by a competition between the aforementioned force of attraction between monomers and the formidable conformational entropy of polymer chains. Any factor that affects this conformational entropy, whether that is an equilibrium thermodynamic factor or a kinetic factor, has the ability to control polymer crystallization. In this thesis, we focus on understanding the underlying kinetic processes that occur during this phase transition from liquid polymer to the solid semicrystalline state using computer simulations and some experiments. We first investigate the effect of chain ends on crystallization by comparing between the crystallization behavior of linear and ring polymers of the same molecular weight using Langevin dynamics simulations. We find single linear polymers to melt at much larger temperatures than single ring polymers, in apparent contradiction of equilibrium thermodynamic arguments. We study several kinetic factors, and find that they explain this discrepancy. We then study the melting of linear polymers by Langevin dynamics simulations to understand the processes occurring during their disassembly. We find that polymer chains go through a globular metastable state at lower melting temperatures before transforming to expanded coils at higher melting temperatures. We also compute a free energy landscape using parallel tempering Langevin dynamics simulations, and confirm the existence of metastable states in the crystalline-amorphous reaction coordinate. We look at the crystallization of triblock copolymers using Langevin dynamics simulations, in which crystallizable blocks are separated by non-crystallizable ones to understand the effect of impurities. We investigate the effects of tailored interblock and solvent-block interactions, and discover a rich system in which the final semicrystalline polymer forms an array of morphologies. We also experimentally investigate the crystallization of calcium oxalate, which is a primary constituent of kidney stones. We crystallize calcium oxalate and show images of crystals obtained from an optical microscope. Lastly, we extend the scope of our studies into the effect of impurities by looking at crystallization of branched polymers. We discover that branches affect the kinetics of crystallization when they are in close proximity with one another.},

These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this architecture performs competitively or beyond strong, specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 on ImageNet without convolutions and by directly attending to 50,000 pixels. It also surpasses state-of-the-art results for all modalities in AudioSet.},

  abstract = {We report the sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for the human GM12878 Utah/Ceph cell line using the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) nanopore sequencer. 91.2 Gb of sequence data, representing \${\textbackslash}sim\$30{\texttimes} theoretical coverage, were produced. Reference-based alignment enabled detection of large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. De novo assembly of nanopore reads alone yielded a contiguous assembly (NG50 \${\textbackslash}sim\$3 Mb). We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 {$>$} 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5{\texttimes} coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 \${\textbackslash}sim\$6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%. Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus in its entirety, measurement of telomere repeat length, and closure of gaps in the reference human genome assembly GRCh38.},

The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by AM1 atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections (BCCs), which have been parameterized against the HF/6-31G{${_\ast}$} electrostatic potential (ESP) of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus BCI (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit BCCs simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and heteroaromatics, using only 41 BCC parameters. AM1-BCC yields charge sets of comparable quality to HF/6-31G{${_\ast}$} ESP-derived charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct ESP-fit methods. We then apply the BCC parameters to a small ``test set'' consisting of aspirin, D-glucose, and eryodictyol; the AM1-BCCmodel again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with HF/6-31G{${_\ast}$} RESP charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square (RMS) error in ESP. Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the AM1-BCCmodel to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule.},

  abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of Ͼ2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.},

We have measured the translocation times for an equimolar mixture of four different molecular weight NaPSS standards and observed distinct translocation time distribution peaks, each of which corresponding to the different components in the mixture. Size exclusion chromatography analyses were performed on the equimolar and equiweight NaPSS mixtures of the same components and compared with the translocation time measurements. The experimental results demonstrate that measuring translocation times can be a competitive technique for estimating the broad molecular weight distributions of polyelectrolytes.

  abstract = {The unique properties of deep eutectic solvents make them useful in a variety of applications. In this work we develop a first-principles force field for reline, which is composed of choline chloride and urea in the molar ratio 1:2. We start with the symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) protocol and then make adjustments to better reproduce the structure and dynamics of the liquid when compared to first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. The resulting force field is in good agreement with experiments in addition to being consistent with the FPMD simulations. The simulations show that primitive molecular clusters are preferentially formed with choline-chloride ionic pairs bound with a hydrogen bond in the hydroxyl group and that urea molecules coordinate the chloride mainly via the trans-H chelating hydrogen bonds. Incorporating polarizability qualitatively influences the radial distributions and lifetimes of hydrogen bonds and affects long-range structural order and dynamics. The polarizable force field predicts a diffusion constant about an order of magnitude larger than the nonpolarizable force field and is therefore less computationally intensive. We hope this study paves the way for studying complex hydrogen-bonding liquids from a first-principles approach.},

  abstract = {The classical Voorn-Overbeek thermodynamic theory of complexation and phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is generalized to account for the charge accessibility and hydrophobicity of polyions, size of salt ions, and pH variations. Theoretical predictions of the effects of pH and salt concentration are compared with published experimental data and experiments we performed, on systems containing poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as the polyacid and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) or poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) as the polybase. In general, the critical salt concentration below which the mixture phase separates, increases with degree of ionization and with the hydrophobicity of polyelectrolytes. We find experimentally that as the pH is decreased below 7, and PAA monomers are neutralized, the critical salt concentration increases, while the reverse occurs when pH is raised above 7. We predict this asymmetry theoretically by introducing a large positive Flory parameter (= 0.75) for the interaction of neutral PAA monomers with water. This large positive Flory parameter is supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which show much weaker hydrogen bonding between neutral PAA and water than between charged PAA and water, while neutral and charged PDMAEMA show similar numbers of hydrogen bonds. This increased hydrophobicity of neutral PAA at reduced pH increases the tendency towards phase separation despite the reduction in charge interactions between the polyelectrolytes. Water content and volume of coacervate are found to be a strong function of the pH and salt concentration.},

  abstract = {The effects of osmolytes, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), on the phase transition in an aqueous solution of polymer, protein, or DNA are very complex, and several phase transitions can occur. In order to explore such effects, we take a simple ternary system of poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) and a favorable solvent pair TMAO and water to monitor the reduction in the miscibility of the polymer using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The result shows that the LCST of PDEA solutions is significantly depressed by TMAO. Although DLS data clearly show that aggregates can form as precursors in the homogeneous one-phase region depending on the TMAO concentration, after removing the low-q aggregate region, the three-component system still obeys the mean-field theory. Based on the ternary random phase approximation (RPA) theory, three Flory{\textendash}Huggins interaction parameters, i.e., {$\chi$}D2O{\textendash}TMAO, {$\chi$}PDEA{\textendash}TMAO, and {$\chi$}PDEA{\textendash}D2O, are obtained to reveal the microscopic origin of this shift in LCST; that is, the strong TMAO{\textendash}D2O interaction leads to the decrease of LCST. Our study opens up many directions to explore effects such as the interference between aggregation and microphase separation.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \&\#x201C;ImageNet\&\#x201D;, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNN) has been considered as an attractive modelling method for molecular property prediction, and numerous studies have shown that GNN could yield more promising results than traditional descriptor-based methods. In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles. All in all, we believe that the off-the-shelf descriptor-based models still can be directly employed to accurately predict various chemical endpoints with excellent computability and interpretability.},

  abstract = {The effects of chain topology on the self-assembly of block copolymers are examined using an ABAT block copolymer, composed of an AB diblock copolymer with an extra A block tethered onto the B block, as a model system. The topology of the ABAT block copolymer is regulated by the tethering point, such that the block copolymer changes continuously from linear ABA triblock copolymer to A2B miktoarm star copolymer as the tethering position moves from the B end to the AB junction. The phase diagrams of ABAT copolymers of different tethering positions are constructed using the self-consistent field theory. The theoretical results reveal that the phase behavior of the system depends sensitively on the topology of the ABAT copolymers. In particular, a considerably wide stable region of the perforated lamellar (PL) phase is predicted for ABAT with proper tethering positions. The PL phase could even completely replaces the gyroid phase at relatively strong segregation. Furthermore, a large window of the hexagonally close-packed (hcp) spherical phase, as well as a direct transition from hcp to the cylindrical phase, is predicted. An analysis of the distributions of the different blocks reveals that the local segregation of the two different B blocks occurs to accommodate the topological constraints due to the chain architecture, which in turn regulates the local interfacial curvature and chain packing resulting in the different phase behaviors.},

  abstract = {The fundamental attributes of charged hydrogels containing predominantly water and controllable amounts of low molar mass electrolytes are of tremendous significance in biological context and applications in healthcare. However, a rigorous theoretical formulation of gel behavior continues to be a challenge due to the presence of multiple length and time scales in the system which operate simultaneously. Furthermore, chain connectivity, the electrostatic interaction, and the hydrodynamic interaction all lead to long-range interactions. In spite of these complications, considerable progress has been achieved over the past several decades in generating theories of variable complexity. The present review presents an analytically tractable theory by accounting for correlations emerging from topological, electrostatic, and hydrodynamic interactions. Closed-form formulas are derived for charged hydrogels to describe their swelling equilibrium, elastic moduli, and the relationship between microscopic properties such as gel diffusion and macroscopic properties such as elasticity. In addition, electrostatic coupling between charged moieties and their ion clouds, which significantly modifies the elastic diffusion coefficient of gels, and various scaling laws are presented. The theoretical formulas summarized here are useful to adequately capture the essentials of the physics of charged gels and to design new hydrogels with specified elastic and dynamical properties.},

Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a per-pixel loss between the output and ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality images can be generated by defining and optimizing perceptual loss functions based on high-level features extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al. in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives visually pleasing results.},

  abstract = {Helicases are molecular motors that separate DNA strands for efficient replication of genomes. We probed the kinetics of individual ring-shaped T7 helicase molecules as they unwound double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or translocated on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A distinctive DNA sequence dependence was observed in the unwinding rate that correlated with the local DNA unzipping energy landscape. The unwinding rate increased {$\sim$}10-fold (approaching the ssDNA translocation rate) when a destabilizing force on the DNA fork junction was increased from 5 to 11 pN. These observations reveal a fundamental difference between the mechanisms of ring-shaped and nonring-shaped helicases. The observed force-velocity and sequence dependence are not consistent with a simple passive unwinding model. However, an active unwinding model fully supports the data even though the helicase on its own does not unwind at its optimal rate. This work offers insights into possible ways helicase activity is enhanced by associated proteins. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Voids within crystalline microporous solids are represented here using stochastic distributions of rays placed and oriented randomly within the accessible void space, represented using Voronoi decompositions. This algorithm is provided in the Zeo++ software for open use. In this method, ray lengths are depicted as two-dimensional histograms that complement alternate descriptors, such as free and included sphere diameters. We illustrate the specific use of these methods as a tool to narrow the range of zeolites useful for a given catalytic application because of the shape and size of voids. DAC, AFS, AFY, SFO and EON zeolites contain void spaces similar, as suggested by Euclidean distance values between histograms, to those within MOR 8-MR side pockets, which stabilize the transition states that mediate dimethyl ether carbonylation to methyl acetate; these alternate structures offer different connecting void environments, which can enhance or restrict molecular access and influence the effectiveness of the 8-MR protons. NES, EON and USI zeolites exhibit histogram features similar to those of 12-MR MOR channels, where protons selectively catalyze alkylation of biphenyl and naphthalene to 4,4{${'}$}- diisopropylbiphenyl and 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene, respectively, with propene. SBT, FAU and SBS contain voids similar in topology to the 12-MR channels of LTL zeolites, within which Pt clusters remain active and stable during the dehydrocyclization of light alkanes, but without the one-dimensional nature of LTL channels. The approach and implementation of these methods are applicable to any microporous or mesoporous solids and to adsorption processes driven by van der Waals contacts between hosts and guest molecules. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

Translocation of DNA is a crucial step in nanopore-based sequencing platforms, where control over translocation speed remains one of the main challenges. Taking advantage of the interactions between negatively charged DNA and positively charged amino acid residues, the translocation speed of DNA can be manipulated by deliberate charge decorations inside the nanopore. We employed coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations to monitor the step-by-step movement of DNA through different mutations of {$\alpha$}-hemolysin protein nanopores. We found that although the average translocation time per nucleotide is longer, in agreement with experiments, the DNA nucleotides do not translocate with a uniform speed. Furthermore, the location and spacing of the charge decorations can alter the translocation dynamics significantly, trapping DNA in some cases. Our findings can give insights when designing charge patterns in nanopores.},

Methods: We undertook a feasibility study on six clinically significant pathogens, comparing the MinION to the Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII platforms. Genomic DNAwas prepared and sequenced using theMinION as instructed by the manufacturer, and Illumina MiSeq and PacBio sequencing was performed using established methods. Results: An evaluation of the accuracy of theMinION based on sequencing of an MRSA isolate showed that error rates were higher in the MinION reads, but provided an even coverage across the entire genome length. The MinION detected all of the expected carbapenemases and ESBL genes in five Gram-negative isolates and the mecA gene in an MRSA isolate. Conclusions: The MinION can detect the presence of acquired resistance genes, but improvements in accuracy are needed so that antimicrobial resistance associated with mutations in chromosomal genes can be identified.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Supervised machine learning (ML) methods have shown potential for identifying the phase boundaries of lattice models. In this work, we extend these ML methods to continuous-space systems. We propose a convolutional neural network model that utilizes grid-interpolated coordinates of molecules as input data of ML and optimizes the search for phase transitions with different filter sizes. We test the method for the phase diagram of two off-lattice models, namely, the Widom-Rowlinson model and a symmetric freely jointed polymer blend, for which results are available from standard molecular simulations techniques. The ML results show good agreement with results of previous simulation studies with the added advantage that there is no critical slowing down. We find that understanding intermediate structures near a phase transition and including them in the training set is important to obtain the phase boundary near the critical point. The method is quite general and easy to implement and could find wide application to study the phase behavior of complex fluids.},

  abstract = {The phase behavior of polymers in room temperature ionic liquids is a topic of considerable interest. In this work we study the phase diagram of poly(ethylene oxide) in four imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) using molecular simulation. We develop united atom models for 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium ([BMMIM]), 1-ethyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium ([EMMIM]), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([EMIM]) in an analogous fashion to previously developed models for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([BMIM]) and tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]) using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. At high temperatures we obtain the coexistence concentrations using an interface method where the polymer and IL are simulated in a large elongated box, and an interface between coexisting phases is formed. At lower temperatures we use a deep neural network (DNN) method. The input descriptors for the DNN are the cohesive energy of mixing, the volume change of mixing, and the coordination numbers between cation and polymer, all of which are obtained from simulations of mixed systems at a series of temperatures. The DNN is trained by using the phase-separated systems at high temperatures and a mixed phase at low temperatures. The method predicts a lower critical solution temperature which decreases as the alkyl chain length on the cation is decreased, consistent with experiment. The simulations show that methylation of the cation has little effect on the phase diagram. This is in contrast to what is seen in experiments but could be because the polymer chains in the simulations are too short. At low temperatures the chains display two conformational motifs, namely a crown ether conformation and a ring conformation, each of which can wrap the chain around a single cation. This provides the entropic penalty for mixing and a reason for demixing as the temperature is raised. Such conformations might not be possible for longer chains. The combination of data-driven techniques and molecular simulation shows promise in the study of the phase behavior and physical properties of complex fluids.},

One of the most important properties of NPEC is their ability to participate in intermacromolecular exchange and substitution reactions in aqueous solutions. The kinetics of exchange and substitution reactions has been studied by the method of luminescence quenching. It has been found that such reactions proceed by the contact mechanism and that addition of low molecular electrolytes to the reaction mixtures results in a dramatic increase in the rates of the reactions. The kinetics of the reactions is well described by the equation q = 1-exp(- kt{$\propto$}) (here q is the degree of conversion and {$\propto$} {$<$} 1), deduced under the assumption that exchange and substitution occur by the nucleation mechanism and the development of nuclei is inhibited in time. The studied reactions represent a new class of interpolymer reactions and they can be very important, in particular, for understanding the mechanism of functioning of biologically important macromolecules and for the interpretation of the physiological activity of polyelectrolytes.},

  abstract = {We present results of improving the OPLS-AA force field for peptides by means of refitting the key Fourier torsional coefficients. The fitting technique combines using accurate ab initio data as the target, choosing an efficient fitting subspace of the whole potential-energy surface, and determining weights for each of the fitting points based on magnitudes of the potential-energy gradient. The average energy RMS deviation from the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G** data is reduced by ca. 40\% from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged dipeptides, Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals sigma 's and epsilon 's is proved through reproducing gas-phase energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure model liquids. Moreover, a novel approach to fitting torsional parameters for electrostatically charged molecular systems has been presented and successfully tested on five dipeptides with charged side chains.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) methods for prediction and forecasting has become widespread across the quantitative sciences. However, there are many known methodological pitfalls, including data leakage, in ML-based science. In this paper, we systematically investigate reproducibility issues in ML-based science. We show that data leakage is indeed a widespread problem and has led to severe reproducibility failures. Specifically, through a survey of literature in research communities that adopted ML methods, we find 17 fields where errors have been found, collectively affecting 329 papers and in some cases leading to wildly overoptimistic conclusions. Based on our survey, we present a fine-grained taxonomy of 8 types of leakage that range from textbook errors to open research problems. We argue for fundamental methodological changes to ML-based science so that cases of leakage can be caught before publication. To that end, we propose model info sheets for reporting scientific claims based on ML models that would address all types of leakage identified in our survey. To investigate the impact of reproducibility errors and the efficacy of model info sheets, we undertake a reproducibility study in a field where complex ML models are believed to vastly outperform older statistical models such as Logistic Regression (LR): civil war prediction. We find that all papers claiming the superior performance of complex ML models compared to LR models fail to reproduce due to data leakage, and complex ML models don't perform substantively better than decades-old LR models. While none of these errors could have been caught by reading the papers, model info sheets would enable the detection of leakage in each case.},

  abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in image classification, but still show room for improvement in object-detection tasks with many categories, in particular for cluttered scenes and occlusion. Modern detection algorithms like Regions with CNNs (Girshick et al., 2014) rely on Selective Search (Uijlings et al., 2013) to propose regions which with high probability represent objects, where in turn CNNs are deployed for classification. Selective Search represents a family of sophisticated algorithms that are engineered with multiple segmentation, appearance and saliency cues, typically coming with a significant run-time overhead. Furthermore, (Hosang et al., 2014) have shown that most methods suffer from low reproducibility due to unstable superpixels, even for slight image perturbations. Although CNNs are subsequently used for classification in top-performing object-detection pipelines, current proposal methods are agnostic to how these models parse objects and their rich learned representations. As a result they may propose regions which may not resemble high-level objects or totally miss some of them. To overcome these drawbacks we propose a boosting approach which directly takes advantage of hierarchical CNN features for detecting regions of interest fast. We demonstrate its performance on ImageNet 2013 detection benchmark and compare it with state-of-the-art methods.},

In particular, we redesign the generator normalization, revisit progressive growing, and regularize the generator to encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes to images. In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model redefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms of existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.},

The passage of each molecule is detected as a transient decrease of ionic current whose duration is proportional to polymer length. Channel blockades can therefore be used to measure polynu- cleotide length.

We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.},

In gaining sufficient accuracy in the readout of the sequence, it is essential to position every nucleotide of the sequence with great accuracy and precision at the interrogation point of the nanopore. A combination of a ratcheting enzyme and a threaded DNA across a protein pore under an electric field is experimentally shown to be a viable method for DNA sequencing within the single-molecule electrophoresis technique. Using coarse-grained models of the enzyme and the protein nanopore, and Langevin dynamics simulations, we have characterized the conformational fluctuations of the DNA inside the nanopore. We show that the conformational fluctuations of DNA are significant for slowly operating enzymes such as phi29 DNA polymerase. Our results imply that there is considerable uncertainty in precisely positioning a nucleotide at the interrogation point of the nanopore. The discrepancy between the results of coarse-grained simulations and the experimentally successful accurate sequencing suggests that additional features of the experiments, such as explicit treatment of electrolyte ions and hydrodynamics, must be incorporated in the simulations to accurately model experimental constructs.

Longest average translocation time is observed for a pattern corresponding to an optimum section length, with a major delay in the translocation time during the pore ejection stage.

  abstract = {One of the major theoretical methods in understanding polymer translocation through a nanopore is the Fokker-Planck formalism based on the assumption of quasi-equilibrium of polymer conformations. The criterion for applicability of the quasi-equilibrium approximation for polymer translocation is that the average translocation time per Kuhn segment, {\guillemotleft}{$\tau$}{\guillemotright}/NK, is longer than the relaxation time {$\tau$}0 of the polymer. Toward an understanding of conditions that would satisfy this criterion, we have performed coarse-grained three dimensional Langevin dynamics and multi-particle collision dynamics simulations. We have studied the role of initial conformations of a polyelectrolyte chain (which were artificially generated with a flow field) on the kinetics of its translocation across a nanopore under the action of an externally applied transmembrane voltage V (in the absence of the initial flow field). Stretched (out-of-equilibrium) polyelectrolyte chain conformations are deliberately and systematically generated and used as initial conformations in translocation simulations. Independent simulations are performed to study the relaxation behavior of these stretched chains, and a comparison is made between the relaxation time scale and the mean translocation time ({\guillemotleft}{$\tau$} {\guillemotright}). For such artificially stretched initial states, {\guillemotleft}{$\tau$} {\guillemotright}/NK {$<$} {$\tau$}0, demonstrating the inapplicability of the quasi-equilibrium approximation. Nevertheless, we observe a scaling of {\guillemotleft}{$\tau$} {\guillemotright} {$\sim$} 1/V over the entire range of chain stretching studied, in agreement with the predictions of the Fokker-Planck model. On the other hand, for realistic situations where the initial artificially imposed flow field is absent, a comparison of experimental data reported in the literature with the theory of polyelectrolyte dynamics reveals that the Zimm relaxation time ({$\tau$}Zimm) is shorter than the mean translocation time for several polymers including single stranded DNA (ssDNA), double stranded DNA (dsDNA), and synthetic polymers. Even when these data are rescaled assuming a constant effective velocity of translocation, it is found that for flexible (ssDNA and synthetic) polymers with NK Kuhn segments, the condition {\guillemotleft}{$\tau$} {\guillemotright}/NK {$<$} {$\tau$}Zimm is satisfied. We predict that for flexible polymers such as ssDNA, a crossover from quasi-equilibrium to non-equilibrium behavior would occur at NK {$\sim$} O(1000).},

The translocation is driven by an externally applied electric field. Our key observation is that translocation kinetics is highly sensitive to the functionality (number of arms) of the star polymer. The mean translocation time is found to vary non-monotonically with polymer functionality, exhibiting a critical value for which translocation is the fastest. The origin of this effect lies in the competition between the higher driving force inside the nanopore and inter-arm electrostatic repulsion in entering the pore, as the functionality is increased. Our simulations also show that the value of the critical functionality can be tuned by varying nanopore dimensions. Moreover, for narrow nanopores, star polymers above a threshold functionality do not translocate at all. These observations suggest the use of nanopores as a high-throughput low-cost analytical tool to characterize and separate star polymers.},

The LC sequences within these proteins are both necessary and sufficient for b-isox-mediated aggregation, and these domains can undergo~a concentration-dependent phase transition to a hydrogel-like state in the absence of the chemical. X-ray diffraction and EM studies revealed the hydrogels to be composed of uniformly polymerized amyloid-like fibers.

In this work, we develop coarse-grained (CG) models for PSS and PVBTMA with explicit CG water and with sodium and chloride counterions, respectively. We benchmark the CG models via a comparison with atomistic simulations for single chains. We find that the choice of the topology and the partial charge distribution of the CG model, both play a crucial role in the ability of the CG model to reproduce results from atomistic simulations. There are dramatic consequences, e.g., collapse of polyions, with injudicious choices of the local charge distribution. The polyanions and polycations exhibit a similar conformational and dynamical behavior, suggesting that the sign~of the polyion charge does not play a significant role.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

The new models are a significant advancement over past data-driven work, in terms of protocol, validity, and versatility. A generalizable fingerprinting method is used for the polymers and solvents, making it possible, in principle, to handle any polymer{\textendash}solvent combination. Our data-driven approach achieves high accuracy when either both the polymer and solvent or just the polymer has been seen during the training phase. Model performance is modest though when a solvent (in a newly queried polymer{\textendash}solvent pair) is not part of the training set. This is likely because the number of unique solvents in our data set is small (much smaller than the number of polymers). Nevertheless, as the data set increases in size, especially as the solvent set becomes more diverse, the overall predictive performance is expected to improve.},

  abstract = {Glyconjugates such as mucins, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides form the structural basis of protective cell-surface layers. In particular gel-forming mucins define a zone between the epithelial cell layer and the environment. Such molecules are of extreme molecular weight 5{\textendash}100 {\texttimes} 106 and size (Rg 20{\textendash}300 nm). On this account their biochemistry is inseparable from their physical biochemistry. Combining laser light scattering and quartz crystal mass balance with dissipation methods (QCM-D) we have investigated the properties of the MUC5B mucin and its cognate fragments when bound to a hydrophobic surface. MUC5B forms the basis of gels responsible for the protection of the oral cavity, lung, and cervical canal surfaces. Here we show, by analyzing dissipative interactions of hydrophobic, gold, and polystyrene surfaces, with the intact MUC5B molecule, its reduced subunits, and glycosylated tryptic fragments (obtained after reduction), the formation of 40- to 100-nm-thick highly structured, hydrated interfaces. These interfaces are dominated in their geometry and dissipative properties by the negatively charged carbohydrate-rich domains of the molecule, the naked protein domains being responsible for attachment. These carbohydrate-rich surfaces have well-defined absorptive properties and permit the entry and entrapment of albumin-coated micro-beads into the absorbed layer at and below a size of 60 nm. However beads larger than 100 nm are completely excluded from the surfaces. These absorptive phenomena correlate with large changes in film dissipation and thus may not only be important in biological functions, e.g. binding viruses, but could also be informative to the surfaces (often ciliated) onto which such mucus films are attached.},

  abstract = {The theory of collapse of weakly charged polyelectrolyte gels is generalized by taking into account the possibility of counter ion trapping with the formation of ion pairs, which becomes progressively important as the gel shrinks and the dielectric constant of the gel medium decreases. A phenomenon well known in the theory of ionomers, namely the aggregation of ion pairs due to dipole-dipole interactions with the formation of multiplets, is also taken into account. These multiplets act as additional physical cross-links. It is shown that accounting for the two effects mentioned above generally leads to an increase of the region of stability of the collapsed phase and to an increase of the jump in volume at the transition point. The most important, qualitatively new effect is the possibility of existence of a new supercollapsed state of a polymer gel which is very close to the densely packed dry gel. The reason for the thermodynamic stability of the supercollapsed state is a loop of positive feedback: the decrease of the volume of the gel leads to a decrease of the dielectric constant and hence to progressive formation of ion pairs, thus the concentration of mobile counter ions and the corresponding osmotic pressure decrease, the gel shrinks further etc. It is possible to realize the phase transitions between all three states of a polymer gel: swollen, ordinary collapsed and supercollapsed.},

The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se. To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large sequences with arbitrarily nonuniform composition. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Recently, machine learning has attracted considerable attention, as it can provide rational guidelines for efficient material exploration without time-consuming iterations or prior human knowledge. In this regard, here we develop an inverse design model based on a deep encoder-decoder architecture for targeted molecular design. Inspired by neural machine language translation, the deep neural network encoder extracts hidden features between molecular structures and their material properties, while the recurrent neural network decoder reconstructs the extracted features into new molecular structures having the target properties. In material design tasks, the proposed fully data-driven methodology successfully learned design rules from the given databases and generated promising light-absorbing molecules and host materials for a phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode by creating new ligands and combinatorial rules.},

  abstract = {Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that around 250 human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, harbour a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a `steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.},

  abstract = {The recent successes of the Materials Genome Initiative have opened up new opportunities for data-centric informatics approaches in several subfields of materials research, including in polymer science and engineering. Polymers, being inexpensive and possessing a broad range of tunable properties, are widespread in many technological applications. The vast chemical and morphological complexity of polymers though gives rise to challenges in the rational discovery of new materials for specific applications. The nascent field of polymer informatics seeks to provide tools and pathways for accelerated property prediction (and materials design) via surrogate machine learning models built on reliable past data. We have carefully accumulated a data set of organic polymers whose properties were obtained either computationally (bandgap, dielectric constant, refractive index, and atomization energy) or experimentally (glass transition temperature, solubility parameter, and density). A fingerprinting scheme that captures atomistic to morphological structural features was developed to numerically represent the polymers. Machine learning models were then trained by mapping the fingerprints (or features) to properties. Once developed, these models can rapidly predict properties of new polymers (within the same chemical class as the parent data set) and can also provide uncertainties underlying the predictions. Since different properties depend on different length-scale features, the prediction models were built on an optimized set of features for each individual property. Furthermore, these models are incorporated in a user-friendly online platform named Polymer Genome (www.polymergenome.org). Systematic and progressive expansion of both chemical and property spaces are planned to extend the applicability of Polymer Genome to a wide range of technological domains.},

Both the nonlinear PB and size-modified PB theories are considered. The number of ions bound to A-RNA, which can be measured experimentally, is well reproduced in all methods. On the other hand, the radial ion distribution profiles show differences between MD and PB. We showed that PB results are sensitive to ion size and functional form of the solvent dielectric region but not the solvent dielectric boundary definition. Size-modified PB agrees with replica exchange molecular dynamics much better than nonlinear PB when the ion sizes are chosen from atomistic simulations. The distribution of ions 14 away from the RNA central axis are reasonably well reproduced by size-modified PB for all ion types with a uniform solvent dielectric model and a sharp dielectric boundary between solvent and RNA. However, this model does not agree with MD for shorter distances from the A-RNA. A distance-dependent solvent dielectric function proposed by another research group improves the agreement for sodium and strontium ions, even for shorter distances from the A-RNA. However, Mg 2+ distributions are still at significant variances for shorter distances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O(\$L\^2\$) to O(\$L{\textbackslash}log L\$), where \$L\$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of \$N\$ times, where \$N\$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.},

A microgel particle consists of coarse-grained linear polymers, which are tetra-functionally crosslinked. Counterions and salt ions are taken into account explicitly, and charge-charge interactions are described by the Coulomb potential. By varying the charge interaction strength and salt concentration, we characterize the swelling of the polyelectrolytes and the charge distribution. In particular, we determine the amount of trapped mobile charges inside the microgel and the Debye screening length. Moreover, we analyze the polymer extension theoretically in terms of the tension blob model taking into account counterions and salt ions implicitly by the Debye{\textendash}H{\"u}ckel model. Our studies reveal a strong dependence of the amount of ions absorbed in the interior of the microgel on the electrostatic interaction strength, which is related to the degree of the gel swelling. This implies a dependence of the inverse Debye screening length {$\kappa$} on the ion concentration; we find a power-law increase of {$\kappa$} with the Coulomb interaction strength with the exponent 3/5 for a salt-free microgel and an exponent 1/2 for moderate salt concentrations. Additionally, the radial dependence of polymer conformations and ion distributions is addressed.},

  abstract = {Poly(styrene) microcapsules, prepared by depositing the polymer around emulsified aqueous droplets, were coated with a synthesized polyelectrolyte; i.e., copolymer of maleic acid (MA) with methyl vinyl ether (MVE), co-poly(MA, MVE), or with styrene (St), copoly(Ma, St). The permeability of the capsule membrane was investigated under various pHs of the outer medium using n-propyl alcohol as a permeant. It became apparent that either copoly(MA, St)- or copoly(MA, MVE)-coated microcapsules function as a pH-sensitive capsule. In particular, the former showed a dramatic change of the permeability in response to small differences in pH (5{\textendash}6). By reference to the viscometric and electrophoretic studies of both copolymers, these were interpreted as being due to a pH-induced alteration of the configuration of the copolymer coating on the surface of the capsule membrane. When sucrose was hydrolyzed in an aqueous suspension of the copoly(MA, St)-coated capsules into which invertase was loaded, the hydrolytic reaction was initiated at pH 5. 5 and stopped at pH 4. 5. Such initiation-cessation control was repeated reversibly without damaging the capsules.},

  abstract = {Direct search methods are best known as unconstrained optimization techniques that do not explicitly use derivatives. Direct search methods were formally proposed and widely applied in the 1960s but fell out of favor with the mathematical optimization community by the early 1970s because they lacked coherent mathematical analysis. Nonetheless, users remained loyal to these methods, most of which were easy to program, some of which were reliable. In the past fifteen years, these methods have seen a revival due, in part, to the appearance of mathematical analysis, as well as to interest in parallel and distributed computing. This review begins by briefly summarizing the history of direct search methods and considering the special properties of problems for which they are well suited. Our focus then turns to a broad class of methods for which we provide a unifying framework that lends itself to a variety of convergence results. The underlying principles allow generalization to handle bound constraints and linear constraints. We also discuss extensions to problems with nonlinear constraints.},

  abstract = {We have performed Langevin dynamics and Poisson-Nernst-Planck calculations to simulate detection of proteins by genetically engineered {$\alpha$}-hemolysin channels. In the recent stochastic sensing experiments, one end of a flexible polymer chain is permanently anchored inside the protein channel at a specified location, and the other end undergoes complexation with an analyte. Our simulations, using coarse-grained modeling, reproduce all essential qualitative results of the electrophysiology measurements of stochastic sensing. In addition, the underlying macromolecular mechanisms behind stochastic sensing are revealed in vivid details. The entropic fluctuations of the conformations of the tethered polymer chain dictate crucially the unique signatures of the ionic current trace of the channel and provide design rules for successful stochastic sensing. The origin of strong fluctuations in the ionic current of the channel is found to arise from the obstruction of the entrance at the {$\beta$}-barrel of the channel by the fluctuating segments of the tether. Silencing of the pore is due to the suppression of conformational fluctuations of the chain, and the permanent blockade of ionic current is due to the threading of the tether through the channel. The onset of silencing and permanent blockade of the channel current cannot necessarily be attributed to the capture of analytes. In order for detection events to be timed accurately, the length and anchoring location of the tether must be tuned appropriately. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Motivation: In recent years, nanopore sequencing technology has enabled inexpensive long-read sequencing, which promises reads longer than a few thousand bases. Such long-read sequences contribute to the precise detection of structural variations and accurate haplotype phasing. However, deciphering precise DNA sequences from noisy and complicated nanopore raw signals remains a crucial demand for downstream analyses based on higher-quality nanopore sequencing, although various basecallers have been introduced to date. Results: To address this need, we developed a novel basecaller, Halcyon, that incorporates neural-network techniques frequently used in the field of machine translation. Our model employs monotonic-attention mechanisms to learn semantic correspondences between nucleotides and signal levels without any pre-segmentation against input signals. We evaluated performance with a human whole-genome sequencing dataset and demonstrated that Halcyon outperformed existing third-party basecallers and achieved competitive performance against the latest Oxford Nanopore Technologies' basecallers.

Polyelectrolyte complex capsules consisting of these polymers were prepared. Influence of the hydrophobic units on pH-responsive release property of the capsules was studied using phenylethylene glycol as a permeant. When the copolymer with styrene unit content of 5.7\% or the poly(ethylenimine) with the benzylated unit content of 2.4{\textendash}10.6\% was used as the membrane components, the permeability of the capsule membrane became minimum and was 10{\textendash}20 fold lower than that of the poly(acrylic acid){\textendash}poly(ethylenimine) complex capsule membrane in the pH region between 3 and 7. In contrast, the hydrophobic units did not lower the permeability of the capsule membranes significantly below pH 3 and above pH 7. Thus, the capsule membranes containing hydrophobic units exhibited remarkable permeability changes in the narrow pH regions of 2{\textendash}3 and 7{\textendash}9. Also, the capsule containing the benzylated PEI in the membrane changed the release rate of the contents very quickly, in response to the ambient pH alteration. Therefore, polyelectrolyte complex capsules, which are highly sensitive to pH change, were obtained by using the polyelectrolytes with the hydrophobic units as membrane components. {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {This work describes an improved version of the original OPLS-all atom (OPLS-AA) force field for carbohydrates (Damm et al., J Comp Chem 1997, 18, 1955). The improvement is achieved by applying additional scaling factors for the electrostatic interactions between 1,5- and 1,6-interactions. This new model is tested first for improving the conformational energetics of 1,2-ethanediol, the smallest polyol. With a 1,5-scaling factor of 1.25 the force field calculated relative energies are in excellent agreement with the ab initio-derived data. Applying the new 1,5-scaling makes it also necessary to use a 1,6-scaling factor for the interactions between the C4 and C6 atoms in hexopyranoses. After torsional parameter fitting, this improves the conformational energetics in comparison to the OPLS-AA force field. The set of hexopyranoses included in the torsional parameter derivation consists of the two anomers of D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-galactose, as well as of the methyl-pyranosides of D-glucose, D-mannose. Rotational profiles for the rotation of the exocyclic group and of different hydroxyl groups are also compared for the two force fields and at the ab initio level of theory. The new force field reduces the overly high barriers calculated using the OPLS-AA force field. This leads to better sampling, which was shown to produce more realistic conformational behavior for hexopyranoses in liquid simulation. From 10-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of alpha-D-glucose and alpha-D-galactose the ratios for the three different conformations of the hydroxymethylene group and the average (3)J(H,H) coupling constants are derived and compared to experimental values. The results obtained for OPLS-AA-SEI force field are in good agreement with experiment whereas the properties derived for the OPLS-AA force field suffer from sampling problems. The undertaken investigations show that the newly derived OPLS-AA-SEI force field will allow simulating larger carbohydrates or polysaccharides with improved sampling of the hydroxyl groups.},

In this study, we present graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) as an architecture that allows for successfully predicting the properties of compounds from diverse domains of chemical space, using a minimal set of meaningful descriptors. The applicability of GCNN models has been demonstrated by a wide range of chemical domain-specific properties. Their performance is comparable to state-of-the-art techniques; however, this architecture exempts from the need to carry out precise feature engineering.},

Such an oracle would revolutionize science and technology as we know them. However, as scientists, we would not be satisfied with the oracle itself. We want more. We want to comprehend how the oracle conceived these predictions. This feat, denoted as scientific understanding, has frequently been recognized as the essential aim of science. Now, the ever-growing power of computers and artificial intelligence poses one ultimate question: How can advanced artificial systems contribute to scientific understanding or achieve it autonomously? We are convinced that this is not a mere technical question but lies at the core of science. Therefore, here we set out to answer where we are and where we can go from here. We first seek advice from the philosophy of science to understand scientific understanding. Then we review the current state of the art, both from literature and by collecting dozens of anecdotes from scientists about how they acquired new conceptual understanding with the help of computers. Those combined insights help us to define three dimensions of android-assisted scientific understanding: The android as a I) computational microscope, II) resource of inspiration and the ultimate, not yet existent III) agent of understanding. For each dimension, we explain new avenues to push beyond the status quo and unleash the full power of artificial intelligence's contribution to the central aim of science. We hope our perspective inspires and focuses research towards androids that get new scientific understanding and ultimately bring us closer to true artificial scientists.},

  abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

  abstract = {Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it diffcult to learn a good set of filters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signifcantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.},

Proteins folding at or near the speed limit are prime candidates for all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. They may also have no free energy barrier, allowing the direct observation of intermediate structures on the pathways from the unfolded to the folded state. Both experimental and theoretical approaches predict a speed limit of approximately N/100{$\mu$}s for a generic N-residue single-domain protein, with {$\alpha$} proteins folding faster than {$\beta$} or {$\alpha\beta$}. The predicted limits suggest that most known ultrafast folding proteins can be engineered to fold more than ten times faster.},

Advanced polymer fingerprinting and deep-learning schemes that incorporate multitask learning and meta learning are proposed. A large data set containing over 18\,000 data points of glass transition, melting, and degradation temperature of homopolymers and copolymers of up to two monomers is used to demonstrate the copolymer prediction efficacy.

Surrogate models that can be trained to predict properties of polymers are becoming commonplace. Nevertheless, these models do not utilize the full breadth of the knowledge available in datasets, which are oftentimes sparse; inherent correlations between different property datasets are disregarded. Here, we demonstrate the potency of multi-task learning approaches that exploit such inherent correlations effectively. Data pertaining to 36 different properties of over 13,000 polymers are supplied to deep-learning multi-task architectures. Compared to conventional single-task learning models, the multi-task approach is accurate, efficient, scalable, and amenable to transfer learning as more data on the same or different properties become available. Moreover, these models are interpretable. Chemical rules, that explain how certain features control trends in property values, emerge from the present work, paving the way for the rational design of application specific polymers meeting desired property or performance objectives.},

The stability limit of the disordered phase for salt-free melt has been calculated using random phase approximation (RPA) and self-consistent-field theory (SCFT). Explicit analytical free energy expressions for different classical ordered microstructures (lamellar, cylinder, and sphere) are presented. The authors demonstrate that the chemical mismatch required for the onset of microphase separation ({$\chi$}*N) in charged-neutral diblock melt is higher and the period of ordered microstructures is lower than those for the corresponding neutral-neutral diblock system. Theoretical predictions on the period of ordered structures in terms of Coulomb electrostatic interaction strength, chain length, block length, and chemical mismatch between blocks are presented. SCFT has been used to go beyond the stability limit, where electrostatic potential and charge distribution are calculated self-consistently. Stability limits calculated using RPA are in perfect agreement with the corresponding SCFT calculations. Limiting laws for the stability limit and the period of ordered structures are presented and comparisons are made with an earlier theory. Also, transition boundaries between different morphologies have been investigated.},

The transition is induced cooperatively by counterion adsorption and chain conformations, and the calculation is done self-consistently. The size of the PE chain is a single-valued function of charge. The discontinuous transition of the coil size is accompanied by a discontinuous transition of the charge. Phase boundaries for the coil-globule transitions induced by both Coulomb strength (inverse temperature or dielectric constant) and ionic strength (salt) show that the PE chain collapses at a substantially lower Coulomb strength in the presence of salt. In the expanded state of the coil, an analytical formula is derived for the effective charge of the chain for conditions where the coupling between chain conformations and counterion adsorption is weak. In general, the dielectric heterogeneity of the solvent close to the polymer backbone is found to play a crucial role in the charge regularization and the chain collapse.},

Phys. 120, 9343 (2004)] that considers the Bjerrum length, salt concentration, and local dielectric heterogeneity as physical variables in the system. Self-consistent calculations of effective charge and size of the polymer show that divalent counterions replace condensed monovalent counterions in competitive adsorption. The theory further predicts that at modest physical conditions for a flexible polyelectrolytes such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate in aqueous solutions polymer charge is compensated and reversed with increasing divalent salt. Consequently, the polyelectrolyte shrinks and reswells. Lower temperatures and higher degrees of dielectric heterogeneity between chain backbone and solvent enhance condensation of all species of ions. Complete diagrams of states for the effective charge calculated as functions of the Coulomb strength and salt concentration suggest that (a) overcharging requires a minimum Coulomb strength and (b) progressively higher presence of salt recharges the polymer due to either electrostatic screening (for low Coulomb strengths) or coion condensation (for high Coulomb strengths). Consideration of ion-bridging by divalent counterions leads to a first-order collapse of polyelectrolytes in modest presence of divalent salts and at higher Coulomb strengths. The authors' theoretical predictions are in agreement with the generic results from experiments and simulations.},

  abstract = {Polyelectrolyte complex micelles have great potential as gene delivery vehicles because of their ability to encapsulate charged nucleic acids forming a core by neutralizing their charge, while simultaneously protecting the nucleic acids from non-specific interactions and enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, to enhance specificity and transfection efficiency, polyelectrolyte complex micelles can be modified to include targeting capabilities. Here, we describe the design of targeted polyelectrolyte complex micelles containing inhibitors against dys-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) that promote atherosclerosis, a leading cause of human mortality and morbidity. Inhibition of dys-regulated miRNAs in diseased cells associated with atherosclerosis has resulted in therapeutic efficacy in animal models and has been proposed to treat human diseases. However, the non-specific targeting of microRNA inhibitors via systemic delivery has remained an issue that may cause unwanted side effects. For this reason, we incorporated two different peptide sequences to our miRNA inhibitor containing polyelectrolyte complex micelles. One of the peptides (Arginine-Glutamic Acid-Lysine-Alanine or REKA) was used in another micellar system that demonstrated lesion-specific targeting in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. The other peptide (Valine-Histidine-Proline-Lysine-Glutamine-Histidine-Arginine or VHPKQHR) was identified via phage display and targets vascular endothelial cells through the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In this study we have tested the in vitro efficacy and efficiency of lesion- and cell-specific delivery of microRNA inhibitors to the cells associated with atherosclerotic lesions via peptide-targeted polyelectrolyte complex micelles. Our results show that REKA-containing micelles (fibrin-targeting) and VHPKQHR-containing micelles (VCAM-1 targeting) can be used to carry and deliver microRNA inhibitors into macrophages and human endothelial cells, respectively. Additionally, the functionality of miRNA inhibitors in cells was demonstrated by analyzing miRNA expression as well as the expression or the biological function of its downstream target protein. Our study provides the first demonstration of targeting dys-regulated miRNAs in atherosclerosis using targeted polyelectrolyte complex micelles and holds promising potential for translational applications.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations, experimental titrations and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments were used to investigate the conformational and electrical properties of polyacrylic acids (PAA). On the one hand, titration curves were calculated to get an insight into the role of pH on the degree of ionization and conformation of PAA chains. On the other hand, experimental potentiometric titrations of PAA were also achieved for different PAA molecular weights and compared to the calculated titration curves obtained by Monte Carlo coarse grained simulations. It was found that for a large range at intermediate PAA ionizations, a good correlation is obtained between experimental and simulations data thanks to the prominence of electrostatic interactions in this domain. The effect of ionic concentration and PAA molecular weight on the titration curves was also investigated. In order to get a better understanding of PAA conformational behavior, we also investigated PAA diffusion properties in aqueous solutions as a function of pH and ionic strength by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), thanks to its high sensitivity to measure diffusion coefficients of tracer solutes. Good qualitative agreements were observed between experimental diffusivities and polymer properties calculated from MC simulations. It was shown that the high molecular weight PAA chains display more significant changes in diffusivity in agreement with the ionization degrees and conformational changes observed in the simulations.},

  abstract = {Synopsis Variable skin pH values are being reported in literature, all in the acidic range but with a broad range from pH 4.0 to 7.0. In a multicentre study (N = 330), we have assessed the skin surface pH of the volar forearm before and after refraining from showering and cosmetic product application for 24 h. The average pH dropped from 5.12 {$\pm$} 0.56 to 4.93 {$\pm$} 0.45. On the basis of this pH drop, it is estimated that the `natural' skin surface pH is on average 4.7, i.e. below 5. This is in line with existing literature, where a relatively large number of reports (c. 50\%) actually describes pH values below 5.0; this is in contrast to the general assumption, that skin surface pH is on average between 5.0 and 6.0. Not only prior use of cosmetic products, especially soaps, have profound influence on skin surface pH, but the use of plain tap water, in Europe with a pH value generally around 8.0, will increase skin pH up to 6 h after application before returning to its `natural' value of on average below 5.0. It is demonstrated that skin with pH values below 5.0 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5.0, as shown by measuring the biophysical parameters of barrier function, moisturization and scaling. The effect of pH on adhesion of resident skin microflora was also assessed; an acid skin pH (4{\textendash}4.5) keeps the resident bacterial flora attached to the skin, whereas an alkaline pH (8{\textendash}9) promotes the dispersal from the skin.},

Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy, but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce ``GraphCast,'' a machine learning-based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables, over 10 days at 0.25{\textdegree} resolution globally, in under one minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclones tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting, and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {Multi-label image classification is the task of predicting a set of labels corresponding to objects, attributes or other entities present in an image. In this work we propose the Classification Transformer (C-Tran), a general framework for multi-label image classification that leverages Transformers to exploit the complex dependencies among visual features and labels. Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme to represent the state of the labels as positive, negative, or unknown during training. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome. Moreover, because our model explicitly represents the uncertainty of labels during training, it is more general by allowing us to produce improved results for images with partial or extra label annotations during inference. We demonstrate this additional capability in the COCO, Visual Genome, News-500, and CUB image datasets.},

We find good agreement with the assumption of affine swelling for the weakly entangled networks of our study. The same scaling relations (up to numerical coefficients) are obtained for the vector order parameter, m, and the tensor order parameter, S, as a function of the preparation conditions, network structure, the equilibrium degree of swelling, Q, and the modulus at swelling equilibrium, G. We obtain m {$\propto$} Q{\textendash}2 and G {$\propto$} m3/2 for swelling in theta solvents and m {$\propto$} Q{\textendash}1.08 with G {$\propto$} m2.14 in the good-solvent regime, in both cases independent of preparation conditions.

  abstract = {The geometry of surrounding water molecules on the side chain of glycine, alanine, {$\alpha$}-aminoisobutyric acid, {$\alpha$}-aminobutyric acid, valine, and related hydrocarbons has been analyzed combining bottom-up and quantum chemical methodologies. To minimize the cavity size and to prevent water-water hydrogen bonding loss, the water molecules adopt a shape, resembling the one found in crystal structure of gas clathrate hydrates, with water molecules tangentially oriented to the surface of hydrophobic side chain. The cage is directly hydrogen bonded to the backbone's polar groups, thus hydration shells around hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups are folded together in amphiphilic molecules. The hydrophobe enclathration implies a substantial freedom degree reduction which makes it entropically disfavored. This disadvantageous entropic contribution is partially compensated by the favorable van der Waals interactions with guest in stabilizing clathrate hydrate formation. The water shell around the side chain relates intimately with the side-chain rotational isomerism. Present data are correlated with the experimental determined populations of the three rotamers, yielding promising results for both {$\alpha$}-aminobutyric acid and valine.},

Forces applied in SPRNT mimic forces and physical barriers PcrA experiences in vivo, such as when the helicase encounters bound proteins or duplex DNA; we show how PcrA's kinetics change with such stimuli. SPRNT allows for direct association of the underlying DNA sequence with observed enzyme kinetics. Our data reveal that the underlying DNA sequence passing through the helicase strongly influences the kinetics during translocation and unwinding. Surprisingly, unwinding kinetics are not solely dominated by the base-pairs being unwound. Instead, the sequence of the single stranded DNA on which the PcrA walks determines much of the kinetics of unwinding.},

Electronic structure calculations are playing an increasingly relevant role in this search, but large-scale materials screening efforts are hindered by computationally expensive transition state barrier calculations. The purpose of the present letter is twofold. First, we show that, for the wide range of catalysts that proceed via a radical intermediate, a unifying framework for predicting C-H activation barriers using a single universal descriptor can be established. Second, we combine this scaling approach with a thermodynamic analysis of active site formation to provide a map of methane activation rates. Our model successfully rationalizes the available empirical data and lays the foundation for future catalyst design strategies that transcend different catalyst classes.},

The results from this study extend the range of RG values available in the literature to plasmid sizes typically used for gene therapy and DNA vaccines. The experimental data were compared with available theoretical expressions based on the worm-like chain model, with the best-fit value of the apparent persistence length for both the linear and open-circular isoforms being statistically identical at 46 nm. A new expression was developed for the radius of gyration of the supercoiled plasmid based on a model for linear DNA using an effective contour length that is equal to a fraction of the total contour length. These results should facilitate the development of micro/nano-fluidic devices for DNA manipulation and size-based separation processes for plasmid DNA purification. Biotechnol.

  abstract = {We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be massively sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that "mix" input tokens. These linear transformations, along with simple nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, are sufficient to model semantic relationships in several text classification tasks. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92\% of the accuracy of BERT on the GLUE benchmark, but pre-trains and runs up to seven times faster on GPUs and twice as fast on TPUs. The resulting model, which we name FNet, scales very efficiently to long inputs, matching the accuracy of the most accurate "efficient" Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark, but training and running faster across all sequence lengths on GPUs and relatively shorter sequence lengths on TPUs. Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint and is particularly efficient at smaller model sizes: for a fixed speed and accuracy budget, small FNet models outperform Transformer counterparts.},

Muthukumar, Macromolecules 35, 9142 (2002)], which accounts for conformational fluctuations of chains, charge density correlations arising from dissolved ions, hydrophobic interaction between polymer backbone and solvent, and translational entropy of all species in the system. The theory is at the mean field level and recovers the results of the restricted primitive model with the Debye{\textendash}H{\"u}ckel description for solutions of simple electrolytes without any polymer chains and those of the Flory{\textendash}Huggins and scaling theories for uncharged polymers in the absence of charges or electrolytes. In constructing the phase diagrams, the chemical potential of each of the species is maintained to be the same in the coexisting phases and at the same time each phase being electrically neutral (Donnan equilibrium). Comparisons are made with a more constrained situation where the chemical potentials of the independent components are maintained to be the same in the coexisting phases. Our calculations predict several rich phenomena. Even for the salt-free solutions, two critical phenomena (corresponding to the Flory{\textendash}Huggins-type and the restricted-primitive-model-type critical points) are predicted. The coupling between these two leads to two critical end points and triple points. In the presence of salt, the valency of electrolyte ions is found to influence drastically the phase diagrams. Specifically, the predicted liquid-liquid phase transitions in certain temperature ranges is reminiscent of the re-entrant-precipitation phenomenon observed experimentally for polyelectrolytes condensed with trivalent salts.},

A test application of methane storage in zeolites reveals excellent agreement in the methane working capacity values of top performing structures between the real zeolites and the shapes generated from our neural network. Moreover, even when the real zeolites with the highest working capacity values are excluded from the input training sets, our neural network generates shapes that yield large working capacity values that are close to the true maximum value. With further development, this method can be extended to other applications and materials, thereby providing rational guidance to construct reasonable performance targets for future development of materials.},

For these applications it is therefore important to identify the optimal pore geometry and use this information to find similar materials. However, the mathematical language and tools to identify materials with similar pore structures, but different composition, has been lacking. We develop a pore recognition approach to quantify similarity of pore structures and classify them using topological data analysis. This allows us to identify materials with similar pore geometries, and to screen for materials that are similar to given top-performing structures. Using methane storage as a case study, we also show that materials can be divided into topologically distinct classes requiring different optimization strategies.},

More recently, as throughput and accuracy have increased, it has been possible to begin work involving more complex genomes and metagenomes. With the release of the high-throughput GridION X5 and PromethION platforms, the sequencing of large genomes will become more cost effcient, and enable the leveraging of extremely long ({$>$}100 kb) reads for resolution of complex genomic structures.

Among these are Parkinson's disease ({$\alpha$}-synuclein), Type II diabetes (islet amyloid polypeptide), and Alzheimer's disease (amyloid {$\beta$}-peptide, A{$\beta$}). The appearance of A{$\beta$} fibrils in neural tissue is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and many studies have been conducted to determine and analyze the structure of these protein aggregates. The principal toxic species in Alzheimer's disease are believed to be soluble, oligomeric aggregates of A{$\beta$}, but numerous studies have found that the insoluble fibrillated form of the peptide also contributes to neurotoxicity. Thus, to design therapeutic agents to combat the progression of Alzheimer's disease, it is worthwhile to understand the thermodynamics of destabilizing these aggregates and the features that contribute to their stability. In this work, we present a systematic study of several factors that influence the stability of A{$\beta$}42 fibrils following in silico mutation. We have employed standard molecular dynamics, as well as center-of-mass pulling and umbrella sampling, to study the thermodynamics of peptide dissociation from the core of a model protofibril at physiological temperature. Results indicate that a finite level of hydration around the Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge is crucial to protofibril stability, while mutation of Phe19 to glycine has no effect on the binding free energy of the terminal peptide. Packing between Ile32 and the aliphatic portion of the Lys28 side chain serves to regulate the level of hydration in the core of the protofibril and thus rigidify the Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge. These observations are important for designing compounds that target A{$\beta$} aggregates; interrupting these native interactions may destabilize these assemblies and ameliorate their toxicity.},

  abstract = {Proteins are macromolecules which possess several unique properties. They are very large (containing 2,000 or more atoms) and complex. Their structures show no obvious regularity but a very subtle regularity is apparent upon close examination. We know from the fact that proteins may be crystallized and further from x-ray crystallography that each atom occupies a unique place in the relative 3dimensional space of the molecule. If we consider a protein containing 2,000 atoms with no structural restrictions, such a macromolecule would possess 6,000 degrees of freedom. We know, however, from x-ray studies and other techniques as well, that there are indeed certain structural restrictions in a polypeptide structure. For example, if we schematically indicate a polypeptide chain as in Figure 1, we find that the 6 atoms in each unit indicated by the dotted lines lie in a common plane. Considerations of such factors allow us to predict only 450},

In the hard case, the calculation of the search directions corresponds to finding the extreme rays of a cone with a degenerate vertex at the origin, a difficult problem. We discuss here how state-of-the-art computational geometry methods make it tractable to solve this problem in connection with generating set search. We also discuss a number of other practical issues of implementation, such as the careful treatment of equality constraints and the desirability of augmenting the set of search directions beyond the theoretically minimal set. We illustrate the behavior of the implementation on several problems from the CUTEr test suite. We have found it to be successful on problems with several hundred variables and linear constraints.},

Starting from an atomistic model of a polymer, two coarser representations are introduced-a coarse-grained model and a slip-spring representation-which successively operate at longer time and length scales. The three models are unified by renormalizing the time and modulus scales, which is achieved through matching their normalized chain mean squared displacement and stress relaxation modulus, respectively. To facilitate the relaxation of entangled chains, the simulations are performed at temperatures higher than those accessible in experiments. Time{\textendash}temperature superposition is then applied to extrapolate the viscoelastic properties calculated at high temperatures to experimentally accessible lower temperatures. This proposed approach can predict the linear rheology of the melt starting from an atomistic model and does not require experimental parameters as an input. Here, it is demonstrated for syndiotactic and atactic polystyrene, where good agreement with experimental measurements is observed.},

  abstract = {Polyelectrolyte coacervates are molecular complexes consisting of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Their properties, such as interfacial tension, microscopic structure, and rheology, depend on the level of salt doping. In this work, we develop a coarse-grained model to study the interfacial, structural, and dynamical properties of coacervates under different salt concentrations. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we prepare coacervates from strong polyelectrolytes in equilibrium with a supernatant phase. The interfacial tension of the coacervate{\textendash}supernatant interface follows a scaling law near the critical salt concentration (csalt,cr) of the form {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} (1 {\textendash} csalt/csalt,cr)3/2 but exhibits deviations at lower salt concentrations. The structure and dynamics of these coacervates are similar to those of neutral polymer solutions with the same polymer concentration, since electrostatic interactions are strongly screened and become essentially short-ranged due to the high concentration of charged species. In coacervates, polyelectrolyte chains adopt ideal conformations, and the correlation length decreases with increasing polymer concentration in a manner that is reminiscent of concentrated polymer solutions in a poor solvent. The relaxation of polyelectrolyte chains, as well as the stress relaxation modulus of coacervates, can be described by the Rouse model. The relaxation time decreases with increasing salt concentration and decreasing polymer concentration. To distinguish the effect of salt and polymer on relaxation, we compare the dynamics of coacervates to those of neutral concentrated polymer solutions at the same polymer density. At low salt concentrations, when the Debye screening length is larger than the correlation length, the coacervate relaxation time depends only on polymer concentration, in a similar way to that observed in a neutral system. At high salt concentrations, the screening of electrostatic interactions accelerates coacervate dynamics. We also demonstrate that by applying appropriate time and modulus shifts, the stress relaxation modulus of coacervates with different salt and polymer concentrations can be superimposed to form a master curve, in agreement with the so-called ``salt{\textendash}time superposition'' principle observed in experiments.},

  abstract = {Many interesting problems in machine learning are being revisited with new deep learning tools. For graph-based semisupervised learning, a recent important development is graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which nicely integrate local vertex features and graph topology in the convolutional layers. Although the GCN model compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods, its mechanisms are not clear and it still requires a considerable amount of labeled data for validation and model selection. In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the GCN model and address its fundamental limits. First, we show that the graph convolution of the GCN model is actually a special form of Laplacian smoothing, which is the key reason why GCNs work, but it also brings potential concerns of over-smoothing with many convolutional layers. Second, to overcome the limits of the GCN model with shallow architectures, we propose both co-training and self-training approaches to train GCNs. Our approaches significantly improve GCNs in learning with very few labels, and exempt them from requiring additional labels for validation. Extensive experiments on benchmarks have verified our theory and proposals.},

A number of computational tools have been developed to facilitate the processing and analysis of the Nanopore data. Previously, we have developed DeepSimulator1.0 (DS1.0), which is the first simulator for Nanopore sequencing to produce both the raw electrical signals and the reads. However, although DS1.0 can produce high-quality reads, for some sequences, the divergence between the simulated raw signals and the real signals can be large. Furthermore, the Nanopore sequencing technology has evolved greatly since DS1.0 was released. It is thus necessary to update DS1.0 to accommodate those changes. Results: We propose DeepSimulator1.5 (DS1.5), all three modules of which have been updated substantially from DS1.0. As for the sequence generator, we updated the sample read length distribution to reflect the newest real reads' features. In terms of the signal generator, which is the core of DeepSimulator, we added one more pore model, the context-independent pore model, which is much faster than the previous context-dependent one. Furthermore, to make the generated signals more similar to the real ones, we added a low-pass filter to post-process the pore model signals. Regarding the basecaller, we added the support for the newest official basecaller, Guppy, which can support both GPU and CPU. In addition, multiple optimizations, related to multiprocessing control, memory and storage management, have been implemented to make DS1.5 a much more amenable and lighter simulator than DS1.0.},

To keep pace with the explosion of the downstream data analytical tools, a versatile Nanopore sequencing simulator is needed to complement the experimental data as well as to benchmark those newly developed tools. However, all the currently available simulators are based on simple statistics of the produced reads, which have difficulty in capturing the complex nature of the Nanopore sequencing procedure, the main task of which is the generation of raw electrical current signals. Results: Here we propose a deep learning based simulator, DeepSimulator, to mimic the entire pipeline of Nanopore sequencing. Starting from a given reference genome or assembled contigs, we simulate the electrical current signals by a context-dependent deep learning model, followed by a base-calling procedure to yield simulated reads. This workflow mimics the sequencing procedure more naturally. The thorough experiments performed across four species show that the signals generated by our context-dependent model are more similar to the experimentally obtained signals than the ones generated by the official context-independent pore model. In terms of the simulated reads, we provide a parameter interface to users so that they can obtain the reads with different accuracies ranging from 83 to 97\%. The reads generated by the default parameter have almost the same properties as the real data.

Here we demonstrate a solid-state nanopore microscope capable of observing individual molecules of double-stranded DNA and their folding behaviour.

From early beginnings using off-the-shelf materials, the field has grown tremendously, driven in part by the innovations of chemical engineers. Modern advances in drug delivery are now predicated upon the rational design of polymers tailored for specific cargo and engineered to exert distinct biological functions. In this review, we highlight the fundamental drug delivery systems and their mathematical foundations and discuss the physiological barriers to drug delivery. We review the origins and applications of stimuli-responsive polymer systems and polymer therapeutics such as polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates. The latest developments in polymers capable of molecular recognition or directing intracellular delivery are surveyed to illustrate areas of research advancing the frontiers of drug delivery.},

As prototypical water-soluble organic substances, we consider neutral poly-glycine, poly-ethylene glycol, and charged monomeric propionic acid. As the water content is reduced, the dielectric constant decreases but does not follow an ideal mixing behavior. The deviations from ideal mixing originate primarily in the non-linear relation between the oligomer mass fraction and collective polarization effects. We find that the dielectric constant is dominated by water polarization, even if the oligomer mass fraction exceeds 50\%. By a double extrapolation of the MD simulation results to the limit of vanishing water fraction and to the limit of infinite oligomeric chain length, we estimate the orientational contribution to the dielectric constant of the pure polymeric melts. By this procedure, we obtain {$\varepsilon$} = 17 {$\pm$} 2 for polyglycine and {$\varepsilon$} = 1 {$\pm$} 0.3 for polyethylene glycol. The large difference is rationalized by polarization correlations of glycine units. Interestingly, we find constant temperature simulations to outperform replica exchange simulations in terms of equilibration speed.},

Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {$>$}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashingbased software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. Availability: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net.

However this technology is currently hindered by high error rates in the output data that affect analyses such as the identification of isoforms, exon boundaries, open reading frames and creation of gene catalogues. Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited. Results: In this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias toward the major isoform and splice site detection. We find that long read error correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of Nanopore RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base pair accuracy. Yet investigators should be warned that the correction process perturbs gene family sizes and isoform diversity.

  abstract = {Marine mussels attach to substrates using adhesive proteins. It has been suggested that complex coacervation (liquid{\textendash}liquid phase separation via concentration) might be involved in the highly condensed and non-water dispersed adhesion process of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs). However, as purified natural MAPs are difficult to obtain, it has not been possible to experimentally validate the coacervation model. In the present work, we demonstrate complex coacervation in a system including recombinant MAPs and hyaluronic acid (HA). Our recombinant hybrid MAPs, fp-151 and fp-131, can be produced in large quantities, and are readily purified. We observed successful complex coacervation using cationic fp-151 or fp-131, and an anionic HA partner. Importantly, we found that highly condensed complex coacervates significantly increased the bulk adhesive strength of MAPs in both dry and wet environments. In addition, oil droplets were successfully engulfed using a MAP-based interfacial coacervation process, to form microencapsulated particles. Collectively, our results indicate that a complex coacervation system based on MAPs shows superior adhesive properties, combined with additional valuable features including liquid/liquid phase separation and appropriate viscoelasticity. Our microencapsulation system could be useful in the development of new adhesive biomaterials, including self-adhesive microencapsulated drug carriers, for use in biotechnological and biomedical applications.},

Why engage in such a strategy when an exploitation-free alternative is readily available whereby public goods are kept private? We address this by examining metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in its native form and by creating a new three-strain synthetic community deploying different strategies of sucrose metabolism. Public-metabolizers digest resources externally, private-metabolizers internalize resources before digestion, and cheats avoid the metabolic costs of digestion but exploit external products generated by competitors. A combination of mathematical modelling and ecological experiments reveal that private-metabolizers invade and take over an otherwise stable community of public-metabolizers and cheats. However, owing to the reduced growth rate of private-metabolizers and population bottlenecks that are frequently associated with microbial communities, privatizing public goods can become unsustainable, leading to population decline.},

An excess of spheres are supplied outside the unit cell. The concept of natural tiling can be one of the solutions. According to the theory of tiling, a three dimensional net can be decomposed into a number of face sharing, edge-sharing, and vertex-sharing three-dimensional polyhedral tiles. The way all of the tiles assemble together is the tiling of the net. By comparing the T-ring graphs corresponding to different probes, one can easily generate preliminary conclusions about the selectivity of mixtures of guest species corresponding to a specific zeolite framework.},

Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various ``no-flattening theorems'' showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss; for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2 n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

  abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature.

Our general expression for the Helmholtz free energy of the system is in terms of density profiles of the various components and is an explicit function of the sequence specificity of the heteropolymers, polymer concentration, salt concentration, chemical mismatch among the various monomers and solvent, and temperature. We illustrate our general theory in the context of the self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins by considering solutions of sequence-specific charged-neutral heteropolymers. For the heteropolymers under consideration, the system exhibits microphase separation. The boundaries of order{\textendash}disorder transition and the relative stabilities of the canonical microphase-separated morphologies (lamellar, cylindrical, and spherical) are presented in the weak segregation limit as functions of sequence, polymer concentration, chemical mismatch parameters, and salt concentration. Unique mapping between heteropolymer sequence and morphology diagram is presented.

  abstract = {The nanopore sensing method holds the promise of delivering a single molecule technology for identification of biological proteins, direct detection of post-translational modifications, and perhaps de novo determination of a protein's amino acid sequence. The key quantity measured in such nanopore sensing experiments is the magnitude of the ionic current passing through a nanopore blocked by a polypeptide chain. Establishing a relationship between the amino acid sequence of a peptide fragment confined within a nanopore and the blockade current flowing through the nanopore remains a major challenge for realizing the nanopore protein sequencing. Using the results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, here we compare nanopore sequencing of DNA with nanopore sequencing of proteins. We then delineate the factors affecting the blockade current modulation by the peptide sequence, showing that the current can be determined by (i) the steric footprint of an amino acid, (ii) its interactions with the pore wall, (iii) the local stretching of a polypeptide chain, and (iv) the local enhancement of the ion concentration at the nanopore constriction. We conclude with a brief discussion of the prospects for purely computational prediction of the blockade currents.},

  abstract = {Zeolites are one of the most widely used materials in the chemical industry due to their nanometer-sized pores that can adsorb and react upon molecules selectively. With hundreds of known framework topologies and hundreds of thousands of computationally predicted structures, the ability to rapidly predict zeolite performance allows researchers to prioritize their efforts on the most promising structures for a given application. Although the accuracy of forcefield-based atomistic simulations has advanced significantly in the past two decades, these simulations can be computationally expensive, especially for long-chain, complex molecules. We present ZeoNet, a representation learning framework using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) and 3D volumetric representations for predicting adsorption in zeolites. ZeoNet was trained on the task of predicting Henry's constants for adsorption, kH, of n-octadecane in more than 330 000 known and predicted zeolite materials. Employing a 3D grid based on the distances to solvent-accessible surfaces, a volumetric representation that can be generated efficiently, the best-performing ZeoNet achieved a correlation coefficient r2 = 0.977 and a mean-squared error MSE = 3.8 in ln kH, which corresponds to an error of 9.3 kJ mol-1 in adsorption free energy. In comparison, a model based on hand-designed geometric features has values of r2 = 0.783 and MSE = 35.7. ZeoNet is also relatively efficient and can process {$\approx$}8 structures per second on an Nvidia RTX 2080TI GPU, orders of magnitude faster than forcefield-based simulations. A systematic analysis was conducted to investigate how the choice of ConvNet architectures, the linear dimension (L) and spatial resolution ({$\Delta$}d) of the distance grids, batch size, optimizer, and learning rate impact the model performance. We found that ConvNets based on the ResNet architecture offer the best tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency. The performance for all models reaches a plateau at L = 30{\textendash}45 {\AA} and depends less sensitively on grid resolution, with a small benefit around {$\Delta$}d = 0.30{\textendash}0.45 {\AA}. Finally, saliency maps were visualized to identify which regions of the materials contributed the most to model predictions. It was found, interestingly, that the predictions are driven primarily by the accessible pore volume rather than the region occupied by the framework atoms.},

In the present work this is achieved by utilizing poly-2-vinylpyridine quaternized to 4.3\% with ethylbromide. Conductivity and light scattering measurements were utilized to study the polyion collapse in isorefractive solvent/nonsolvent mixtures consisting of 1-propanol and 2-pentanone, respectively, at nearly constant dielectric constant. The solvent quality of the uncharged polyion could be quantified which, for the first time, allowed the experimental investigation of the effect of the electrostatic interaction prior and during polyion collapse, by comparing to a newly developed theory. Although the Manning parameter for the investigated system is as low as lB/l = 0.6 (lB is the Bjerrum length and l is the mean contour distance between two charges), that is, no counterion binding should occur, a qualitative interpretation of the conductivity data revealed that the polyion chain already collects its counterions when the dimensions start to shrink below the good solvent limit but are still well above the {\texttheta}-dimension.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixelsto-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build ``fully convolutional'' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves stateof-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

This approach includes specific molecular details and conformational degrees of freedom of the polymeric gel, acid-base equilibrium, and solution entropy as well as electrostatic, van der Waals, and excluded-volume interactions. Here, we study polyacid gels in good solvent. The physical properties of the gel are found to depend on the coupling between charge regulation and the molecular interactions. In particular, the gel's degree of dissociation is not only determined by the bath pH and ionic strength but also by the polymer's ability in regulating charge to modify the local environment and in swelling or shrinking that depends on the externally controlled variables. The gel pH can be several units smaller than the bath pH depending on the salt ion concentration. The gel pH does not respond linearly to changes in neither bath pH nor c, and its behavior results from the complex interplay between the conformational degrees of freedom and all of the interactions mentioned above. The gel system swells if pH {$>$} pKa and collapses if pH {$<$} pKa. The continuous transition between collapsed and swollen regimes occurs in a very narrow range of bath pH around pKa whose width depends on the salt concentration. In this intermediate region the volume fraction of the polyacid can be controlled by both c and pH.},

It was predicted that a distant counterion polarizes the SCL as if it were a metallic surface and creates an electrostatic image. The attractive potential energy of the image is the reason why the charge density of counterions decreases faster with distance from the charged surface than in PB theory. Using the Monte Carlo method to find the equilibrium distribution of counterions around the macroion, we confirm the existence of the image potential energy. It is also shown that, due to the negative screening length of the SCL, -2{$\xi$}, the effective metallic surface is actually above the SCL by |{$\xi$}|.},

Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

We used molecular simulations to determine how the net charge per monomer and the ionization states of individual acidic and basic groups differ from the ideal (Henderson{\textendash}Hasselbalch) behavior. To complement the theoretical predictions, we performed potentiometric titrations and zeta-potential measurements of all studied polyzwitterions. By comparing these experiments with theoretical predictions, we could show that molecular simulations can predict and explain the origin of the differences between the effective and bare pKa values of individual titratable groups. Furthermore, we have shown that it is not possible to obtain these effective pKa values directly from the equivalence point recognition criterion (ERC), commonly used in potentiometric titrations. However, the effective pKa values can be reliably obtained by calculating the net charge per monomer from the potentiometric titration curves and validating these results against theoretical predictions. The approach we propose works reliably for polyzwitterions in which the ionization response is dominated by electrostatic interactions, such as PDAGA or PDha; however, it fails if other specific interactions contribute significantly, such as in the case of PImAA.},

The closeness are measured by three classes of integral probability metrics between probability distributions: 1-Wasserstein distance, maximum mean distance (MMD) and kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). We prove upper bounds for the size (width and depth) of the deep neural network in terms of the dimension d and the approximation error {$\epsilon$} with respect to the three discrepancies. In particular, the size of neural network can grow exponentially in d when 1-Wasserstein distance is used as the discrepancy, whereas for both MMD and KSD the size of neural network only depends on d at most polynomially. Our proof relies on convergence estimates of empirical measures under aforementioned discrepancies and semi-discrete optimal transport.},

  abstract = {Oxford Nanopore sequencing is fastly becoming an active field in genomics, and it's critical to basecall nucleotide sequences from the complex electrical signals. Many efforts have been devoted to developing new basecalling tools over the years. However, the basecalled reads still suffer from a high error rate and slow speed. Here, we developed an open-source basecalling method, CATCaller, by simultaneously capturing global context through Attention and modeling local dependencies through dynamic convolution. The method was shown to consistently outperform the ONT default basecaller Albacore, Guppy, and a recently developed attention-based method SACall in read accuracy. More importantly, our method is fast through a heterogeneously computational model to integrate both CPUs and GPUs. When compared to SACall, the method is nearly 4 times faster on a single GPU, and is highly scalable in parallelization with a further speedup of 3.3 on a four-GPU node.},

  abstract = {Polyelectrolyte solutions have been proposed as a method to improve the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries by increasing the cation transference number because the polymer self-diffusion coefficient is much lower than that of the counterion. However, this is not necessarily true for the polymer mobility. In some cases, negative transference numbers have been reported, which implies that the lithium ions are transporting to the same electrode as the anion, behavior that is often attributed to a binding of counterions to the polyion. We use a simple model where we bind some counterions to the polymer via harmonic springs to investigate this phenomenon. We find that both the number of bound counterions and the strength of their binding alter the transference number, and, in some cases, the transference number is negative. We also investigate how the transference number depends on the Manning parameter, the ratio of the Bjerrum length to charge separation along the chain. By altering the Manning parameter, the transference number can almost be doubled, which suggests that charge spacing could be a way to increase the transference number of polyelectrolyte solutions.},

  abstract = {Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.},

This effect was explained by an unequal salt concentration (cs) between equilibrating phases that improves the relationship between the common cs{\textendash}cp representation and T{\textendash}cp along a salt isopleth in terms of a T{\textendash}cs{\textendash}cp phase envelope. Further quantification of the cloud points and spinodal temperatures predicts regions of metastability and instability with critical points on a salt isopleth phase diagram. As the cloud point is approached, the correlation length for concentration fluctuations far exceeds the chain dimensions with evidence of a crossover from mean field to fluctuation regime. The effective critical exponents for the divergence in the osmotic compressibility, via scattered intensity to zero angle and correlation length, {$\gamma$}eff and {$\nu$}eff, respectively, deviates from the 3D Ising model. These static light-scattering measurements illustrate that concentration fluctuations are enhanced by polyelectrolyte chain association near the lower critical solution temperature.},

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques are being applied in quantifying structure{\textendash}property relationships for a wide variety of materials, where the properly represented materials play key roles. Although algorithms for representation learning are extensively studied, their applications to domain-specific areas, such as polymers, are limited largely due to the lack of benchmark databases. In this work, we investigate different types of polymer representations, including Morgan fingerprint (MF), molecular embedding (ME), and molecular graph (MG), based on the benchmark database from a subset of the well-known web-based polymer databases, PolyInfo. We evaluate the quality of different polymer representations via quantifying the relationships between the representations and polymer properties, including density, melting temperature, and glass transition temperature. Different representation learning schemes for MEs, such as supervised learning, semisupervised learning, and transfer learning, are investigated. In supervised learning, only labeled molecules in our benchmark database are used for representation learning, in semisupervised learning, both labeled and unlabeled molecules in our benchmark database are used, and in transfer learning, molecules from an external database that is different from the benchmark database are used for representation learning. It is found that ME (with the R2 of 0.724 in the density case, 0.684 in the melting temperature case, and 0.865 in the glass transition temperature case) outperforms the other representations for structure{\textendash}property relationship quantification in all cases studied, and MG (with the R2 of 0.260 in the density case, -0.149 in the melting temperature case, and 0.711 in the glass transition case) is shown to be much inferior to ME and MF (with the R2 of 0.562 in the density case, 0.645 in the melting temperature case, and 0.849 in the glass transition case), likely due to the relatively small volumes of training data available. For MEs, it is found that the similarities of substructure MEs under different learning schemes (e.g., SL, SSL, and TL) are differently estimated, thus leading to different performance scores in structure{\textendash}property relation quantification. Combinations of MEs show little effect on predictive performance when comparing to the single MEs in the corresponding regression tasks, proving no information gain in mixing MEs.},

Isotropic potentials describe nonbonded interactions, implicitly taking into account the solvent conditions to match the experimentally determined radius of gyration of ssDNA. The model reproduces experimentally measured force-extension dependence of an unstructured DNA strand across 2 orders of magnitude of the applied force. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by measuring the end-to-end distance of a dT14 fragment via FRET while stretching the molecules using optical tweezers. The model offers straightforward generalization to systems containing double-stranded DNA and DNA binding proteins.},

  abstract = {We have performed Langevin dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model of ejection of dsDNA from {$\Phi$}29 phage. Our simulation results show significant variations in the local ejection speed, consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature for both in vivo and in vitro systems. In efforts to understand the origin of such variations in the local speed of ejection, we have investigated the correlations between the local ejection kinetics and the packaged structures created at various motor forces and chain flexibility. At lower motor forces, the packaged DNA length is shorter with better organization. On the other hand, at higher motor forces typical of realistic situations, the DNA organization inside the capsid suffers from significant orientational disorder, but yet with long orientational correlation times. This in turn leads to lack of registry between the direction of the DNA segments just to be ejected and the direction of exit. As a result, a significant amount of momentum transfer is required locally for successful exit. Consequently, the DNA ejection temporarily slows down exhibiting pauses. This slowing down occurs at random times during the ejection process, completely determined by the particular starting conformation created by prescribed motor forces. In order to augment our inference, we have additionally investigated the ejection of chains with deliberately changed persistence length. For less inflexible chains, the demand on the occurrence of large momentum transfer for successful ejection is weaker, resulting in more uniform ejection kinetics. While being consistent with experimental observations, our results show the nonergodic nature of the ejection kinetics and call for better theoretical models to portray the kinetics of genome ejection from phages. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {We present a new model and method for the Monte Carlo simulation of silica polymerization in aqueous solution. We focus on the idea that silica structures are built from corner sharing tetrahedra and these tetrahedra are the basic units of the model. Rather than use a reactive force field, the assembly of tetrahedral units is accomplished via Monte Carlo simulation in the reaction ensemble. The simplicity of the model and the use of the reaction ensemble make it possible to study silica polymerization for quite large system sizes, reaching a high degree of condensation under ambient conditions. We find that the reaction ensemble Monte Carlo simulation protocol can provide a description of the overall polymerization kinetics, after making some key assumptions. Very good agreement is obtained when comparing simulated and experimental evolutions of the Qn distribution as a function of both time and degree of condensation, indicating an approximately linear relationship between physical time and number of Monte Carlo steps up to about 5 h. Analyses of cluster-size and ring-size distributions reveal that polymerization proceeds in the following main stages: oligomerization forming small units (0-1 h), ring formation (1-2.6 h), cluster aggregation (2.6-5.6 h), and finally cross-linking of the aging gel at later times. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

From a physical point of view, both experimental and theoretical works have brought quantitative insights into DNA base-pairing dynamics that we review in this Report, putting emphasis on theoretical developments. We discuss the dynamics at the base-pair scale and its pivotal coupling with the polymer one, with a polymerization index running from a few nucleotides to tens of kilo-bases. This includes opening and closure of short hairpins and oligomers as well as zipping and unwinding of long macromolecules. We review how different physical mechanisms are either used by Nature or utilized in biotechnological processes to separate the two intertwined DNA strands, by insisting on quantitative results. They go from thermally-assisted denaturation bubble nucleation to force- or torque-driven mechanisms. We show that the helical character of the molecule, possibly supercoiled, can play a key role in many denaturation and renaturation processes. We categorize the mechanisms according to the relative timescales associated with base-pairing and chain orientational degrees of freedom such as bending and torsional elastic ones. In some specific situations, these chain orientational degrees of freedom can be integrated out, and the quasi-static approximation is valid. The complex dynamics then reduces to the diffusion in a low-dimensional free-energy landscape. In contrast, some important cases of experimental interest necessarily appeal to far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics.},

Whereas remarkable progress has been achieved in the past2, making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library3. This change to this part of the sort library represents the replacement of a component with an algorithm that has been automatically discovered using reinforcement learning. We also present results in extra domains, showcasing the generality of the approach.},

For the purposes of theoretical analysis, we model DNA* as identical to ordinary DNA but supplemented by a longitudinal compression force equal in magnitude but oppositely directed to the stretching (tension) force on DNA caused by phosphate-phosphate repulsions. The null isomer DNA* then becomes an elastically buckled form of fully ionized DNA. On this basis, we derive a nonadditive relationship between the persistence length P of DNA and the persistence length P* of its null isomer. From the formula obtained we can predict the value of P* if P is known, and we can predict the ionic strength dependence of P under the assumption that P* does not depend on ionic strength. We predict a value of P* for null DNA drastically lower than the value of P for DNA in its ordinary state of fully ionized phosphates. The predicted dependence of P on salt concentration is log-c over most of the concentration range, with no tendency toward a salt-independent value in the range of validity of the theory. The predictions are consistent with much of the persistence-length data available for DNA. Alternate theories of the Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman type, including one by the author, are considered skeptically on the grounds that the underlying model may not be realistic. Specifically, we doubt the accuracy for real polyelectrolytes of the Odijk-Skolnik-Fixman assumption that the polymer structure is invariant to changes in electrostatic forces.},

An ionic current passing through a small pore would directly map the sequence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) driven through the constriction.

To study MspA's ability to resolve nucleotides, we held ssDNA within the pore using a biotin-NeutrAvidin complex. We show that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine in MspA exhibit much larger current differences than in {$\alpha$}-hemolysin. Additionally, methylated cytosine is distinguishable from unmethylated cytosine. We establish that single nucleotide substitutions within homopolymer ssDNA can be detected when held in MspA's constriction. Using genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms, we demonstrate that single nucleotides within random DNA can be identified. Our results indicate that MspA has high signal-to-noise ratio and the single nucleotide sensitivity desired for nanopore sequencing devices. {\textcopyright} 2011 Manrao et al.},

  abstract = {Nanopore technologies are being developed for fast and direct sequencing of single DNA molecules through detection of ionic current modulations as DNA passes through a pore's constriction. Here we demonstrate the ability to resolve changes in current that correspond to a known DNA sequence by combining the high sensitivity of a mutated form of the protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) with phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP), which controls the rate of DNA translocation through the pore. As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of {$\sim$}28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42-53 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences. With single-nucleotide resolution and DNA translocation control, this system integrates solutions to two long-standing hurdles to nanopore sequencing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc.

  abstract = {We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL), a model that learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of sentences without explicit supervision on any of them; instead, our model learns by simply looking at images and reading paired questions and answers. Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval.},

  abstract = {Open-source data on large scale are the cornerstones for data-driven research, but they are not readily available for polymers. In this work, we build a benchmark database, called PI1M (referring to {$\sim$}1 million polymers for polymer informatics), to provide data resources that can be used for machine learning research in polymer informatics. A generative model is trained on {$\sim$}12\,000 polymers manually collected from the largest existing polymer database PolyInfo, and then the model is used to generate {$\sim$}1 million polymers. A new representation for polymers, polymer embedding (PE), is introduced, which is then used to perform several polymer informatics regression tasks for density, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and dielectric constants. By comparing the PE trained by the PolyInfo data and that by the PI1M data, we conclude that the PI1M database covers similar chemical space as PolyInfo, but significantly populate regions where PolyInfo data are sparse. We believe that PI1M will serve as a good benchmark database for future research in polymer informatics.},

Here, we describe the structure- based design of a self-assembling protein nano- particle presenting a prefusion-stabilized variant of the F glycoprotein trimer (DS-Cav1) in a repeti- tive array on the nanoparticle exterior. The two- component nature of the nanoparticle scaffold enabled the production of highly ordered, mono- disperse immunogens that display DS-Cav1 at controllable density. In mice and nonhuman pri- mates, the full-valency nanoparticle immunogen displaying 20 DS-Cav1 trimers induced neutralizing antibody responses \$10-fold higher than trimeric DS-Cav1. These results motivate continued devel- opment of this promising nanoparticle RSV vaccine candidate and establish computationally designed two-component nanoparticles as a robust and customizable platform for structure-based vaccine design.},

The use of charged polypeptides {\textendash} (poly)-lysine and (poly)-glutamic acid with identical backbones allowed for facile tuning of the system parameters, including chain length, side-chain functionality, and chirality. Systematic studies using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of liquid PEC coacervates revealed a physical description of these materials as strongly screened semidilute polyelectrolyte solutions comprising oppositely charged chains. At the same time, solid PECs were found to be composed of hydrogen-bonding driven stiff ladder-like structures. While the coacervates behaved akin to semidilute polyelectrolyte solutions upon addition of salt, the solids were largely unaffected by it. Rheology measurements of PEC coacervates revealed a terminal relaxation regime, with an unusual plateauing of the storage modulus at low oscillation frequencies. The plateau may be ascribed to a combination of instrumental limitations and the long-range electrostatic interactions contributing to weak energy storage modes. Excellent superposition of the dynamic moduli was achieved by a time-salt superposition. The shift factors, however, varied more strongly than previously reported with added salt concentration.},

We relate the observed phase behavior to physiological conditions within the gastrointestinal tract with a simulation of the gastroduodenal junction, and demonstrate using video microscopy the viability of polyzwitterionic coacervates as technologies for the pH-triggered release of cargo.

  abstract = {We report a hierarchical multi-scale modeling study of implanted helium segregation on surfaces of tungsten, considered as a plasma facing component in nuclear fusion reactors. We employ a hierarchy of atomic-scale simulations based on a reliable interatomic interaction potential, including molecular-statics simulations to understand the origin of helium surface segregation, targeted molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of near-surface cluster reactions, and large-scale MD simulations of implanted helium evolution in plasma-exposed tungsten. We find that small, mobile Hen (1 {$\leqslant$} n {$\leqslant$} 7) clusters in the near-surface region are attracted to the surface due to an elastic interaction force that provides the thermodynamic driving force for surface segregation. This elastic interaction force induces drift fluxes of these mobile Hen clusters, which increase substantially as the migrating clusters approach the surface, facilitating helium segregation on the surface. Moreover, the clusters' drift toward the surface enables cluster reactions, most importantly trap mutation, in the near-surface region at rates much higher than in the bulk material. These near-surface cluster dynamics have significant effects on the surface morphology, near-surface defect structures, and the amount of helium retained in the material upon plasma exposure. We integrate the findings of such atomic-scale simulations into a properly parameterized and validated spatially dependent, continuum- scale reaction-diffusion cluster dynamics model, capable of predicting implanted helium evolution, surface segregation, and its near-surface effects in tungsten. This cluster-dynamics model sets the stage for development of fully atomistically informed coarse-grained models for computationally efficient simulation predictions of helium surface segregation, as well as helium retention and surface morphological evolution, toward optimal design of plasma facing components.},

  abstract = {Surface morphological evolution under the action of external fields is a fascinating topic that has attracted considerable attention within the surface science community over the past two decades. In addition to the interest in a fundamental understanding of field-induced nonlinear response and stability of surface morphology, the problem has been technologically significant in various engineering applications such as microelectronics and nanofabrication. In this report, we review theoretical progress in modeling the surface morphological response of stressed elastic solids under conditions that promote surface diffusion and of electrically conducting solids under surface electromigration conditions. A self-consistent model of surface transport and morphological evolution is presented that has provided the basis for the theoretical and computational work that is reviewed. According to this model, the surface morphological response of electrically conducting elastic solids to the simultaneous action of mechanical stresses and electric fields is analyzed. Emphasis is placed on metallic surfaces, including surfaces of voids in metallic thin films. Surfaces of stressed elastic solids are known to undergo morphological instabilities, such as the AsaroTiller or Grinfeld (ATG) instability that leads to emanation of crack-like features from the surface and their fast propagation into the bulk of the solid material. This instability is analyzed theoretically, simulated numerically, and compared with experimental measurements. The surface morphological evolution of electrically conducting, single-crystalline, stressed elastic solids under surface electromigration conditions is also examined. We demonstrate that, through surface electromigration, a properly applied and sufficiently strong electric field can stabilize the surface morphology of the stressed solid against both crack-like ATG instabilities and newly discovered secondary rippling instabilities; the effects of important parameters, such as surface crystallographic orientation, on the surface morphological response to the simultaneous action of an electric field and mechanical stress also are reviewed. In addition, electromigration- driven surface morphological response is analyzed systematically, focusing on the current-driven surface morphological evolution of voids in metallic thin films; this analysis has been motivated largely by the crucial role of void dynamics in determining the reliability of metallic interconnects in integrated circuits and has led to the interpretation of a large body of experimental observations and measurements. The electromigration-driven translational motion of morphologically stable voids, effects of current-driven void dynamics on the evolution of the electrical resistance of metallic thin films, and current-driven voidvoid interactions also are reviewed. Furthermore, theoretical studies are reviewed that demonstrated very interesting current-driven nonlinear void dynamics in stressed metallic thin films, including the inhibition of electromigration-induced instabilities due to the action of biaxial tensile stress, and stress effects on the electromigration-driven translational motion of morphologically stable voids. Complex, oscillatory surface states under surface electromigration conditions have been observed in numerical studies. In this report, emphasis is placed on void surfaces in metallic thin films, for which stable time-periodic states have been demonstrated. It is shown that increasing parameters such as the electric-field strength or the void size past certain critical values leads to morphological transitions from steady to time-periodic states; the latter states are characterized by wave propagation on the surface of a void that migrates along the metallic film at constant speed. The transition onset corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation that may be either supercritical or subcritical, depending on the symmetry of the surface diffusional anisotropy as determined by the crystallographic orientation of the film plane. It is also shown that, in the case where the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical, the simultaneous action of mechanical stress leads the current-driven void morphological response to the stabilization of chaotic attractors; in such cases, as the applied stress level increases, the void dynamics is set on a route to chaos through a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations. The observation of current-driven chaotic dynamics in homoepitaxial islands also is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The protein folding (Levinthal's) paradox states that it would not be possible in a physically meaningful time to a protein to reach the native (functional) conformation by a random search of the enormously large number of possible structures. This paradox has been solved: it was shown that small biases toward the native conformation result in realistic folding times of realistic-length sequences. This solution of the paradox is, however, not amenable to most chemistry or biology students due to the demanding mathematics. Here, a simplification of the study of the paradox and its solution is provided so that it is accessible to chemists and biologists at an undergraduate or graduate level. Despite its simplicity, the model captures some fundamental aspects of the protein folding mechanism and allows students to grasp the actual significance of the popular folding funnel representation of the protein energy landscape. The analysis of the folding model provides a rich basis for a discussion of the relationships between kinetics and thermodynamics on a fundamental level and on student perception of the time-scales of molecular phenomena.},

Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of-state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that are either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

These dimensionality reduced features were fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural network (NN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers for automated diagnosis. ICA features in combination with PNN with spread value ({$\sigma$}) of 0.03 performed better than the PCA and LDA.

Our calculation, which traverses the weak- to strong-segregation regimes, is free of traditional approximations. Regions of stability are determined for disordered (DIS) melts and for ordered structures including lamellae (L), hexagonally packed cylinders (H), body-centered cubic spheres (QIm{\=3}m), close-packed spheres (CPS), and the bicontinuous cubic network with Ia{\=3}d symmetry (QIa{\=3}d). The CPS phase exists in narrow regions along the order-disorder transition for {$\chi$}N {$\geq$} 17.67. Results suggest that the QIa{\=3}d phase is not stable above {$\chi$}N {$\sim$} 60. Along the L/QIa{\=3}d phase boundaries, a hexagonally perforated lamellar (HPL) phase is found to be nearly stable. Our results for the bicontinuous Pn{\=3}m cubic (QPn{\=3}m) phase, known as the OBDD, indicate that it is an unstable structure in diblock melts. Earlier approximation schemes used to examine mean-field behavior are reviewed, and comparisons are made with our more accurate calculation.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS{\textemdash}the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases{\textemdash}make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management in- frastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide poly- morphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Here we introduce a minimal model system of colloidal droplet chains7, with programmable DNA interactions that guide their downhill folding into specific geometries. Droplets are observed in real space and time, unravelling the rules of folding. Combining experiments, simulations and theory, we show that controlling the order in which interactions are switched on directs folding into unique structures, which we call colloidal foldamers8. The simplest alternating sequences (ABAB...) of up to 13 droplets yield 11 foldamers in two dimensions and one in three dimensions. Optimizing the droplet sequence and adding an extra flavour uniquely encodes more than half of the 619 possible two-dimensional geometries. Foldamers consisting of at least 13 droplets exhibit open structures with holes, offering porous design. Numerical simulations show that foldamers can further interact to make complex supracolloidal architectures, such as dimers, ribbons and mosaics. Our results are independent of the dynamics and therefore apply to polymeric materials with hierarchical interactions on all length scales, from organic molecules all the way to Rubik's Snakes. This toolbox enables the encoding of large-scale design into sequences of short polymers, placing folding at the forefront of materials self-assembly.},

Electrostatic parameters such as pH, protein net charge, salt concentration, and polymer charge density can be used to modulate protein uptake. While the use of a two-polymer coacervation system enables the encapsulation of weakly charged proteins that would otherwise require chemical modification to facilitate electrostatic complexation, we observed significantly higher uptake for proteins whose structure includes a cluster of like-charged residues on the protein surface. In addition to enhancing uptake, the presence of a charge patch also increased the sensitivity of the system to modulation by other parameters, including the length of the complexing polymers. Lastly, our results suggest that the distribution of charge on a protein surface may lead to different scaling behaviour for both the encapsulation efficiency and partition coefficient as a function of the absolute difference between the protein isoelectric point and the solution pH. These results provide insight into possible biophysical mechanisms whereby cells can control the uptake of proteins into coacervate-like granules, and suggest future utility in applications ranging from medicine and sensing to remediation and biocatalysis.},

Three of the four extremities of each double helix are attached to two microscopic beads, and a stretching force is applied with a dual-beam optical trapping interferometer. We find that overstretching occurs for all four duplexes with small differences between the plateau forces. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) exhibits a smooth transition in contrast to the other three duplexes that show sawtooth patterns, the latter being a characteristic signature of peeling. This difference is observed for a wide range of experimental conditions. We present a theoretical description that explains the difference and predicts that peeling and bubble formation do not occur in overstretching double-stranded RNA. Formation of S-RNA is proposed, an overstretching mechanism that contrary to the other two does not generate single strands. We suggest that this singular RNA property helps RNA structures to assemble and play their essential roles in the biological cell.},

Single- channel recording of the translocation duration and current flow during traversal of individual polynucleotides yielded a unique pattern of events for each of the several polymers tested. Statistical data derived from this pattern of events demonstrate that in several cases a nanopore can distinguish between polynucleotides of similar length and composition that differ only in sequence. Studies of temperature effects on the translocation process show that translocation duration scales as \${\textbackslash}sim\$T-2. A strong correlation exists between the temperature dependence of the event characteristics and the tendency of some polymers to form secondary structure. Because nanopores can rapidly discriminate and characterize unlabeled DNA molecules at low copy number, refinements of the experimental approach demonstrated here could eventually provide a low-cost high- throughput method of analyzing DNA polynucleotides.},

Building an analytical model to do so is especially complicated in modern x86-64 Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) machines with sophisticated processor microarchitectures in that it is tedious, error prone, and must be performed from scratch for each processor generation. In this paper we present Ithemal, the first tool which learns to predict the throughput of a set of instructions. Ithemal uses a hierarchical LSTM-based approach to predict throughput based on the opcodes and operands of instructions in a basic block. We show that Ithemal is more accurate than state-of-the-art hand-written tools currently used in compiler backends and static machine code analyzers. In particular, our model has less than half the error of state-of-the-art analytical models (LLVM's llvm-mca and Intel's IACA). Ithemal is also able to predict these throughput values just as fast as the aforementioned tools, and is easily ported across a variety of processor microarchitectures with minimal developer effort.},

While being extensively tested for their performance in biomedical, membrane, and, to a lesser extent, marine environments, few studies have investigated how the molecular design of the zwitterion may enhance its performance. Furthermore, while theories of zwitterion antifouling mechanisms exist for molecular-scale foulant species (e.g., proteins and small molecules), it remains unclear how molecular-scale mechanisms influence the micro- and macroscopic interactions of relevance for marine applications. The present study addresses these gaps through the use of a modular zwitterion chemistry platform, which is characterized by a combination of surface-sensitive sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy and marine assays. Zwitterions with increasingly delocalized cations demonstrate improved fouling resistance against the green alga Ulva linza. SFG spectra correlate well with the assay results, suggesting that the more diffuse charges exhibit greater surface hydration with more bound water molecules. Hence, the number of bound interfacial water molecules appears to be more influential in determining the marine antifouling activities of zwitterionic polymers than the binding strength of individual water molecules at the interface.},

  abstract = {Attention is a powerful and ubiquitous mechanism for allowing neural models to focus on particular salient pieces of information by taking their weighted average when making predictions. In particular, multi-headed attention is a driving force behind many recent state-of-the-art NLP models such as Transformer-based MT models and BERT. These models apply multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, with each attention "head" potentially focusing on different parts of the input, which makes it possible to express sophisticated functions beyond the simple weighted average. In this paper we make the surprising observation that even if models have been trained using multiple heads, in practice, a large percentage of attention heads can be removed at test time without significantly impacting performance. In fact, some layers can even be reduced to a single head. We further examine greedy algorithms for pruning down models, and the potential speed, memory efficiency, and accuracy improvements obtainable therefrom. Finally, we analyze the results with respect to which parts of the model are more reliant on having multiple heads, and provide precursory evidence that training dynamics play a role in the gains provided by multi-head attention.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have enabled progress in a wide variety of applications. Growing the size of the neural network typically results in improved accuracy. As model sizes grow, the memory and compute requirements for training these models also increases. We introduce a technique to train deep neural networks using half precision floating point numbers. In our technique, weights, activations and gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format. Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range compared to single-precision numbers. We propose two techniques to handle this loss of information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step. This single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training. Secondly, we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of information with half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the memory consumption of deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors, we can also expect a significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.},

However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist1,2. Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.},

We use this catalogue to explore the magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent human evolution.},

We find excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement between theoretical and simulation results. Surprisingly, there emerges a threshold charge fraction of a diblock copolymer beyond which the success rate of translocation is independent of charge fraction. Also, the mean successful translocation time of a diblock copolymer displays non-monotonic behavior with increasing length of the charged block; there is an optimum length of the charged block where the mean translocation rate is the slowest; and there can be a substantial range of higher charge fractions which make the translocation slower than even a minimally charged chain. Additionally, we find for a fixed total charge on the chain, finer distribution along the backbone significantly decreases mean translocation time. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {Interplay of Coulomb interaction energy, free ion entropy, and conformational elasticity is a fascinating aspect in polyelectrolytes (PEs). We develop a theory for complexation of two oppositely charged PEs, a process known to be the precursor to the formation of complex coacervates in PE solutions, to explore the underlying thermodynamics of complex formation, at low salts. The theory considers general degrees of solvent polarity and dielectricity within an implicit solvent model, incorporating a varying Coulomb strength. Explicit calculation of the free energy of complexation and its components indicates that the entropy of free counterions and salt ions and the Coulomb enthalpy of bound ion-pairs dictate the equilibrium of PE complexation. This helps decouple the self-consistent dependency of charge and size of the uncomplexed parts of the polyions, derive an analytical expression for charge, and evaluate the free energy components as functions of chain overlap. Complexation is observed to be driven by enthalpy gain at low Coulomb strengths, driven by entropy gain of released counterions but opposed by enthalpy loss due to reduction of ion-pairs at moderate Coulomb strengths, and progressively less favorable due to enthalpy loss at even higher Coulomb strengths. The total free energy of the system is found to decrease linearly with an overlap of chains. Thermodynamic predictions from our model are in good quantitative agreement with simulations in literature.},

As a result of such chemical diversity, representing, comparing, and learning over macromolecules emerge as critical challenges. To address this, we developed a macromolecule graph representation, with monomers and bonds as nodes and edges, respectively. We captured the inherent chemistry of the macromolecule by using molecular fingerprints for node and edge attributes.

  abstract = {Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials with well-defined cavities and pores, which can be prepared under different pore topologies and chemical compositions. Their preparation is typically defined by multiple interconnected variables (e.g., reagent sources, molar ratios, aging treatments, reaction time and temperature, among others), but unfortunately their distinctive influence, particularly on the nucleation and crystallization processes, is still far from being understood. Thus, the discovery and/or optimization of specific zeolites is closely related to the exploration of the parametric space through trial-and-error methods, generally by studying the influence of each parameter individually.In the past decade, machine learning (ML) methods have rapidly evolved to address complex problems involving highly nonlinear or massively combinatorial processes that conventional approaches cannot solve. Considering the vast and interconnected multiparametric space in zeolite synthesis, coupled with our poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in their nucleation and crystallization, the use of ML is especially timely for improving zeolite synthesis. Indeed, the complex space of zeolite synthesis requires drawing inferences from incomplete and imperfect information, for which ML methods are very well-suited to replace the intuition-based approaches traditionally used to guide experimentation.In this Account, we contend that both existing and new ML approaches can provide the "missing link" needed to complete the traditional zeolite synthesis workflow used in our quest to rationalize zeolite synthesis. Within this context, we have made important efforts on developing ML tools in different critical areas, such as (1) data-mining tools to process the large amount of data generated using high-throughput platforms; (2) novel complex algorithms to predict the formation of energetically stable hypothetical zeolites and guide the synthesis of new zeolite structures; (3) new "ab initio" organic structure directing agent predictions to direct the synthesis of hypothetical or known zeolites; (4) an automated tool for nonsupervised data extraction and classification from published research articles.ML has already revolutionized many areas in materials science by enhancing our ability to map intricate behavior to process variables, especially in the absence of well-understood mechanisms. Undoubtedly, ML is a burgeoning field with many future opportunities for further breakthroughs to advance the design of molecular sieves. For this reason, this Account includes an outlook of future research directions based on current challenges and opportunities. We envision this Account will become a hallmark reference for both well-established and new researchers in the field of zeolite synthesis.},

While the LCD of hnRNPA1 is sufficient to mediate LLPS, the RNA recognition motifs contribute to LLPS in the presence of RNA, giving rise to several mechanisms for regulating assembly. Importantly, while not required for LLPS, fibrillization is enhanced in protein-rich droplets. We suggest that LCD-mediated LLPS contributes to the assembly of stress granules and their liquid properties and provides a mechanistic link between persistent stress granules and fibrillar protein pathology in disease.},

  abstract = {We report a three dimensional Langevin dynamics simulation of a uniformly charged flexible poly- electrolyte chain, translocating through an asymmetric narrow channel with periodically varying cross sections under the influence of a periodic external electric field. When reflection symmetry of the channel is broken, a rectification effect is observed with a favored direction for the chain translocation. For a given volume of the channel unit and polymer length, the rectification occurs below a threshold frequency of the external periodic driving force. We have also observed that the extent of the rectification varies non-monotonically with increasing molecular weight and the strength of geometric asymmetry of the channel. Observed non-monotonicity of the rectification performance has been interpreted in terms of a competition between two effects arising from the channel asymmetry and change in conformational entropy. An analytical model is presented with predictions consistent with the simulation results.},

In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph-and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.},

We find that these three structures exhibit dramatically different aggregation behaviors. For the conditions in our study, PMPC is a swollen excluded-volume chain without significant presence of dipolar correlations as evident from the lack of sensitivity to the ionic strength of the solution. In contrast, PMBP self-assembles into finite-sized structures in solution, which are stabilized by electrostatic dipole{\textendash}dipole interactions. Evidence of these interactions is also present in the diblock polymer, PMPB-b-PMPC, which self-assembles into two distinct, stable aggregates in addition to unaggregated chains. These results contribute to the breadth of understanding of polyzwitterions in solution and provide a platform for future simulation and experimental explorations.},

However, its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we report that BRCA1 is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in response to genotoxic stress, and co-localizes at sites of DNA damage with SUMO1, SUMO2/3 and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. PIAS SUMO E3 ligases co-localize with and modulate SUMO modification of BRCA1, and are required for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. In vitro SUMO modification of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer greatly increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a SUMO-regulated ubiquitin ligase (SRUbL). Further, PIAS SUMO ligases are required for complete accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage-repair proteins subsequent to RNF8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair. These data demonstrate that the SUMOylation pathway plays a significant role in mammalian DNA damage response. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Using a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) [Bart{\'o}k et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 136403 (2010)] as baseline, we accurately machine learn a local model of atomic polarizabilities based on Hirshfeld volume partitioning of the charge density [Tkatchenko and Scheffler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)]. These environment-dependent polarizabilities are then used to parametrize a screened London-dispersion approximation to the vdW interactions. Our ML vdW model only needs to learn the charge density partitioning implicitly, by learning the reference Hirshfeld volumes from density functional theory (DFT). In practice, we can predict accurate Hirshfeld volumes from the knowledge of the local atomic environment (atomic positions) alone, making the model highly computationally efficient. For additional efficiency, our ML model of atomic polarizabilities reuses the same many-body atomic descriptors used for the underlying GAP learning of bonded interatomic interactions. We also show how the method enables straightforward computation of gradients of the observables, even when these remain challenging for the reference method (e.g., calculating gradients of the Hirshfeld volumes in DFT). Finally, we demonstrate the approach by studying the phase diagram of C\textsubscript{60}, where vdW effects are important. The need for a highly accurate vdW-inclusive reactive force field is highlighted by modeling the decomposition of the C\textsubscript{60} molecules taking place at high pressures and temperatures.},

We further find that the effect decreases with distracting news events; increases with user network interactions; and does not hold for posts unrelated to refugees.

The temperature response of free polymer has been widely reported to depend on the concentration and identity of ions in solution and is further modified by the composition of the solvent and presence of cosolutes. However, the influence of polymer architecture on these specific ion effects is relatively unknown. Herein, we compare the current understanding of specific ion effects on free polymer chains and gels with recent studies of polymer brushes. Further studies on mixed salt systems are found to be the next step to predicting the behaviour of these materials in biological systems.},

  abstract = {Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is an essential intermediate in various DNA metabolic processes and interacts with a large number of proteins. Due to its flexibility, the conformations of ssDNA in solution can only be described using statistical approaches, such as flexibly jointed or worm-like chain models. However, there is limited data available to assess such models quantitatively, especially for describing the flexibility of short ssDNA and RNA. To address this issue, we performed FRET studies of a series of oligodeoxythymidylates, (dT)N, over a wide range of salt concentrations and chain lengths (10{$\leq$}N{$\leq$}70 nucleotides), which provide systematic constraints for testing theoretical models. Unlike in mechanical studies where available ssDNA conformations are averaged out during the time it takes to perform measurements, fluorescence lifetimes may act here as an internal clock that influences fluorescence signals depending on how fast the ssDNA conformations fluctuate. A reasonably good agreement could be obtained between our data and the worm-like chain model provided that limited relaxations of the ssDNA conformations occur within the fluorescence lifetime of the donor. The persistence length thus estimated ranges from 1.5nm in 2M NaCl to 3nm in 25mM NaCl.},

The link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry and their mathematical description is strongest when it comes to applications aimed at determining a precise correspondence between atomic configurations and the quantities that one might compute by a quantum mechanical electronic-structure calculation or measure experimentally. The development of atomic-scale representations have played, and continue to play, a central role in the success of machine-learning methods that rely on this correspondence, such as interatomic potentials, as well as generic property models, structural classifiers and low-dimensional maps of structures and datasets. This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of molecules and materials, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks, and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models.

By approaching cations or anions to the hydrogen-donating molecule in the complexes, attractive or repulsive forces were induced, respectively.

The magnitude of the induced forces was consistent with the socalled Hofmeister series, except for non-spherical ions. The forces were also well correlated with charges of the atoms, especially of water proton and oxygen, involving the hydrogen bonds.

This Perspective presents the author's subjective summary of several conceptual advances and the remaining persistent challenges in the contexts of charge and size of polymers, structures in homogeneous solutions, thermodynamic instability and phase transitions, structural evolution with oppositely charged polymers, dynamics in polyelectrolyte solutions, kinetics of phase separation, mobility of charged macromolecules between compartments, and implications to biological systems.},

The ability of the polyelectrolyte chains to self-regulate their effective charge due to the self-consistent coupling between ionization equilibrium and polymer conformations, depending on the dielectric constant, temperature, and polymer concentration, affects the critical phenomena and phase transitions drastically. By considering salt-free polyelectrolyte solutions, we show that the daughter phases have different polymer charges from that of the mother phase. The critical point is also altered significantly by the charge self-regularization of the polymer chains. This work extends the progress made so far in the theory of phase separation of strong polyelectrolyte solutions to a higher level of understanding by considering chains which can self-regulate their charge.},

Even in very dilute solutions such that the chains are not interpenetrating, the chains are still strongly correlated. These correlations are manifest in the measured scattering intensity when such solutions are subjected to light, X-ray, and neutron radiation. The behavior of scattering intensity from polyelectrolyte solutions is qualitatively different from that of solutions of uncharged polymers. Using the technique introduced by Sir Sam Edwards, and extending the earlier work by the author on the thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions, extrapolation formulas are derived for the scattering intensity from polyelectrolyte solutions. The emergence of the polyelectrolyte peak and its concentration dependence are derived. The derived theory shows that there are five regimes. Published experimental data from many laboratories are also collected into a master figure and a comparison between the present theory and experiments is presented.},

(1) arrive at the provocative conclusion that the diffusion constant and the velocity of dsDNA in single molecule electropho- resis are proportional to each other at all voltages. Such a claim, if valid, would destroy the distinction between Newton's law of projectiles and Einstein's law of diffusion. Naturally, the authors' claim cannot be valid. How did the authors come to their erroneous conclusion? The origin of this mishap lies in their data analysis, which uses a model inappropriate for their experiments. While the data are for long dsDNA molecules threading through a narrow-and-thin pore in a single-file manner, their model is for a colloidal particle with a uniform velocity undergoing diffusion in an infi- nitely long pore. The use of a single-file polymer model, appropriate to their experiments, is shown below to capture the essentials of their data, without transgressing the fundamental laws of physics. Additionally, the polymer model predicts that the average time for single-file translocations through the pore is proportional to the polymer length for very long polymers. This prediction is in agreement with the experimental data (1), but contradicts the authors' claim that the average translocation time is universally pro- portional to 1.37-power of DNA length.},

The review will cover the development, promise, and limitations of ``traditional'' computational chemistry (i.e., force field, semiempirical, and density functional theory methods) as it pertains to data generation for inorganic molecular discovery. The review will also discuss the opportunities and limitations in leveraging experimental data sources. We will focus on how advances in statistical modeling, artificial intelligence, multiobjective optimization, and automation accelerate discovery of lead compounds and design rules. The overall objective of this review is to showcase how bringing together advances from diverse areas of computational chemistry and computer science have enabled the rapid uncovering of structure-property relationships in transition-metal chemistry. We aim to highlight how unique considerations in motifs of metal-organic bonding (e.g., variable spin and oxidation state, and bonding strength/nature) set them and their discovery apart from more commonly considered organic molecules. We will also highlight how uncertainty and relative data scarcity in transition-metal chemistry motivate specific developments in machine learning representations, model training, and in computational chemistry. Finally, we will conclude with an outlook of areas of opportunity for the accelerated discovery of transition-metal complexes.},

  abstract = {To investigate the diffusive properties of water in hydrogels, ab initio molecular orbital and molecular dynamics calculations of poly-N,N-dimethylacrylamide-water systems were performed. The results show that the mean diffusion coefficient of water drastically decreases in the middle dehydration stage. In this stage, the mobilities of water are restrained because part of the water forms hydrogen bonds to bind polymer chains due to a glass transition. In addition to the three well-known types of water (i.e., bound, intermediate, and free water) around hydrophilic polymers in hydrogels, our results suggest that the intermediate water can be further classified into two types: first and second intermediate water. The bound and first intermediate water acts as a cross-linker between polymer chains, even if the polymer does not form intra- or intermolecular bonds itself. The diffusive properties of water might have important implications for the interpretation of properties of polymer hydrogels.},

  abstract = {Third-generation DNA sequencers provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) produce a series of samples of an electrical current in the nanopore. Such a time series is used to detect the sequence of nucleotides. The task of translation of current values into nucleotide symbols is called basecalling. Various solutions for basecalling have already been proposed. The earlier ones were based on Hidden Markov Models, but the best ones use neural networks or other machine learning models. Unfortunately, achieved accuracy scores are still lower than competitive sequencing techniques, like Illumina's. Basecallers differ in the input data type{\textemdash}currently, most of them work on a raw data straight from the sequencer (time series of current). Still, the approach of using event data is also explored. Event data is obtained by preprocessing of raw data and dividing it into segments described by several features computed from raw data values within each segment. We propose a novel basecaller that uses joint processing of raw and event data. We define basecalling as a sequence-to-sequence translation, and we use a machine learning model based on an encoder{\textendash}decoder architecture of recurrent neural networks. Our model incorporates twin encoders and an attention mechanism. We tested our solution on simulated and real datasets. We compare the full model accuracy results with its components: processing only raw or event data. We compare our solution with the existing ONT basecaller{\textemdash}Guppy. Results of numerical experiments show that joint raw and event data processing provides better basecalling accuracy than processing each data type separately. We implement an application called Ravvent, freely available under MIT licence.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the synthesis of monomer sequence-defined polymers has expanded into broad-spectrum applications in biomedical, chemical, and materials science fields. Pursuing the characterization and inverse design of these polymer systems requires our fundamental understanding not only at the individual monomer level, but also considering the chain scales, such as polymer configuration, self-assembly, and phase separation. However, our accessibility to this field is still rudimentary due to the limitations of traditional design approaches, the complexity of chemical space along with the burdened cost and time issues that prevent us from unveiling the underlying monomer sequence-structure-property relationships. Fortunately, thanks to the recent advancements in molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the bottlenecks in the tasks of establishing the structure-function correlation of the polymer chains can be overcome. In this review, we will discuss the applications of the integration between ML techniques and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to solve the current issues in polymer science at the chain level. In particular, we focus on the case studies in three important topics{\textemdash}polymeric configuration characterization, feed-forward property prediction, and inverse design{\textemdash}in which CGMD simulations are leveraged to generate training datasets to develop ML-based surrogate models for specific polymer systems and designs. By doing so, this computational hybridization allows us to well establish the monomer sequence-functional behavior relationship of the polymers as well as guide us toward the best polymer chain candidates for the inverse design in undiscovered chemical space with reasonable computational cost and time. Even though there are still limitations and challenges ahead in this field, we finally conclude that this CGMD/ML integration is very promising, not only in the attempt of bridging the monomeric and macroscopic characterizations of polymer materials, but also enabling further tailored designs for sequence-specific polymers with superior properties in many practical applications.},

However, in most cases, modeling coacervation is not easily accessed by molecular simulation methods due to the long-range nature of electrostatic forces and the typically high molecular weights of the species involved. We present a modeling strategy to study complex coacervation leveraging the strengths of both particle simulations and polymer field theory. Field theory is uniquely suited to capture larger-length scales that are inaccessible to particle simulations, but its predictive capability is limited by the need to specify emergent parameters. Using model coacervate-forming systems consisting of poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride), we show an original way to use small-scale, all-atom simulations to parameterize field-theoretic models via the relative entropy coarse-graining approach. The dependence of coacervation on the salt concentration, molecular weight, and charge stoichiometry is predicted without fitting to experimental data and is consistent with experimental trends including asymmetric phase behavior from non-stoichiometric mixtures of polyelectrolytes. This demonstrates a unique simulation approach to study phase behavior in coacervate-forming systems, which is particularly useful when chemical specificity is of interest.},

Novel computational methods are required to improve the accuracy and robustness of DNA methylation state prediction using Nanopore reads.In this study, we develop DeepSignal, a deep learning method to detect DNA methylation states from Nanopore sequencing reads. Testing on Nanopore reads of Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and pUC19 shows that DeepSignal can achieve higher performance at both read level and genome level on detecting 6\,mA and 5mC methylation states comparing to previous hidden Markov model (HMM) based methods. DeepSignal achieves similar performance cross different DNA methylation bases, different DNA methylation motifs and both singleton and mixed DNA CpG. Moreover, DeepSignal requires much lower coverage than those required by HMM and statistics based methods. DeepSignal can achieve 90\% above accuracy for detecting 5mC and 6\,mA using only 2{\texttimes} coverage of reads. Furthermore, for DNA CpG methylation state prediction, DeepSignal achieves 90\% correlation with bisulfite sequencing using just 20{\texttimes} coverage of reads, which is much better than HMM based methods. Especially, DeepSignal can predict methylation states of 5\% more DNA CpGs that previously cannot be predicted by bisulfite sequencing. DeepSignal can be a robust and accurate method for detecting methylation states of DNA bases.DeepSignal is publicly available at https://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/deepsignal.Supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of cations and anions from four different halide solutions, i.e., KF, KCl, KBr, and KI solutions, onto N,N-dimethyl(acrylamidopropyl)ammonium propane sulfonate (DMAAPS) gels prepared using various cross-linker concentrations was investigated at a variety of temperatures; the swelling degrees of the gel in these solutions were also examined. The amount of K{\th} adsorbed coincided with the adsorption of the anions (i.e., I{\`A}, Br{\`A}, Cl{\`A}, or F{\`A}) because of simultaneous adsorption of the cations and anions onto DMAAPS gel. The order of anions, which gave larger amount of K{\th} adsorbed onto the gel, was opposite that of the Hofmeister series, i.e., I{\`A} {$>$} Br{\`A} {$>$} Cl{\`A} {$>$} F{\`A}. Furthermore, the relationship between the degree of swelling of the gel and amount of K{\th} adsorbed onto the gel was elucidated. The data points laid on the same line for the same halide solution even at different cross-linker concentrations or temperatures. At smaller degrees of swelling, the amount of K{\th} adsorbed remained unchanged and then decreased gradually as the degree of swelling increased. In solutions containing anions with lower hydration ability, such as KI, the amount of K{\th} adsorbed decreased at larger degrees of swelling. In contrast, in solutions containing anions with higher hydration abilities, such as KCl, the adsorbed amount of K{\th} decreased at smaller degrees of swelling. Additionally, it was found that, in mixtures of these halide solutions, competitive adsorption of anions occurred. Anions with lower hydration abilities adsorbed more readily in the mixtures than in the single-anion solution. In contrast, anions with higher hydration abilities adsorbed less readily in the mixtures than in the single-anion solution.},

  abstract = {Nanopore DNA sequencing is limited by low base-calling accuracy. Improved base-calling accuracy has so far relied on specialized base-calling algorithms, different nanopores and motor enzymes, or biochemical methods to re-read DNA molecules. Two primary error modes hamper sequencing accuracy: enzyme mis-steps and sequences with indistinguishable signals. We vary the driving voltage from 100 to 200 mV, with a frequency of 200 Hz, across a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore, thus changing how the DNA strand moves through the nanopore. A DNA helicase moves the DNA through the nanopore in discrete steps, and the variable voltage moves the DNA continuously between these steps. The electronic signal produced with variable voltage is used to overcome the primary error modes in base calling. We found that single-passage de novo base-calling accuracy of 62.7 {$\pm$} 0.5\% with a constant driving voltage improves to 79.3 {$\pm$} 0.3\% with a variable driving voltage. The variable-voltage sequencing mode is complementary to other methods to boost the accuracy of nanopore sequencing and could be incorporated into any enzyme-actuated nanopore sequencing device.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in sequencing, structural variants (SVs) remain difficult to reliably detect due to the short read length ({$<$}300 bp) of 2nd generation sequencing. Not only do the reads (or paired-end reads) need to straddle a breakpoint, but repetitive elements often lead to ambiguities in the alignment of short reads. We propose to use the long-reads (up to 20 kb) possible with 3rd generation sequencing, specifically nanopore sequencing on the MinION. Nanopore sequencing relies on a similar concept to a Coulter counter, reading the DNA sequence from the change in electrical current resulting from a DNA strand being forced through a nanometer-sized pore embedded in a membrane. Though nanopore sequencing currently has a relatively high mismatch rate that precludes base substitution and small frameshift mutation detection, its accuracy is sufficient for SV detection because of its long reads. In fact, long reads in some cases may improve SV detection efficiency. We have tested nanopore sequencing to detect a series of well-characterized SVs, including large deletions, inversions, and translocations that inactivate the CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4 tumor suppressor genes in pancreatic cancer. Using PCR amplicon mixes, we have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing can detect large deletions, translocations and inversions at dilutions as low as 1:100, with as few as 500 reads per sample. Given the speed, small footprint, and low capital cost, nanopore sequencing could become the ideal tool for the low-level detection of cancer-associated SVs needed for molecular relapse, early detection, or therapeutic monitoring.},

In addition to membrane-encapsulated compartments, cells can form proteinaceous and membraneless organelles, including nucleoli, Cajal and PML bodies, and stress granules. The principles that determine when and why these structures form have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the disordered tails of Ddx4, a primary constituent of nuage or germ granules, form phase-separated organelles both in live cells and in~vitro. These bodies are stabilized by patterned electrostatic interactions that are~highly sensitive to temperature, ionic strength, arginine methylation, and splicing. Sequence determinants are used to identify proteins found in both membraneless organelles and cell adhesion. Moreover, the bodies provide an alternative solvent environment that can concentrate single-stranded DNA but largely exclude double-stranded DNA. We propose that phase separation of disordered proteins containing weakly interacting blocks is a general mechanism for forming regulated, membraneless organelles.},

In this paper, we first use the variational approach to conformation dynamics to discover the slowest dynamical modes of the simulations. This allows the different metastable states of the system to be located and organized hierarchically. The physical descriptors that characterize metastable states are discovered by means of a machine learning method. We show in the cases of two proteins, Chignolin and Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor, how such analysis can be effortlessly performed in a matter of seconds. Another strength of our approach is that it can be applied to the analysis of both unbiased and biased simulations.},

  abstract = {Ampholytic polymer gels were prepared by {$\gamma$}-ray irradiation to aqueous solutions of two kinds of poly(vinyl alcohol)s containing sulfonate and quaternary ammonium groups, respectively. By adjusting the mixing ratio of the two polymers, three kinds of ampholytic gels were obtained: anionrich, cation-rich, and 1:1 ampholytic ones. These gel samples were immersed in many kinds of salt solutions and buffers to observe the swelling behavior. The swelling degrees of the cation-rich and the anion-rich gels decreased with the increase in the salt concentration (from 0 to 10-3-10-2 M), followed by reswelling with a further increase in the ionic strength of the immersing solutions. The initial deswelling is common to ionic gels and the latter swelling may be ascribed to scission of preformed ionic cross-linking. A similar swelling was also observed for the 1:1 gel, which did not show any decrease in the swelling degree in the lower salt concentration region. A remarkable ion-specificity was noted at the highest salt concentration region above 0.1 M; the three kinds of gels significantly deswelled in solutions containing strongly hydrated anions, such as F-, SO42-, HPO42-, and citrate anion. The ion-specific swelling behavior is discussed in terms of the compatibility of ionic hydration with the polymer hydroxyl group through the electron pair donation and acceptance abilities of the water molecules.},

The use of these food-grade biomacromolecules, in addition to fruits and vegetables, provides edible packaging with suitable physical-mechanical properties as well as unique sensory and nutritional characteristics. This text reviews the chronological development pathway of films based on fruit and vegetable purees, pomaces, and extracts. Recent advances are extensively reviewed with an emphasis on the role that each film component plays in the resulting materials, whose production methods are examined from a technical standpoint and essential properties are compiled and contrasted to their conventional, synthetic counterparts. Finally, this comprehensive review discusses advantages and limitations of edible films based on fruits and vegetables.},

  abstract = {We report a systematic study by Langevin dynamics simulation on the energetics of complexation between two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes of same charge density in dilute solutions of a good solvent with counterions and salt ions explicitly included. The enthalpy of polyelectrolyte complexation is quantified by comparisons of the Coulomb energy before and after complexation. The entropy of polyelectrolyte complexation is determined directly from simulations and compared with that from a mean-field lattice model explicitly accounting for counterion adsorption. At weak Coulomb interaction strengths, e.g., in solvents of high dielectric constant or with weakly charged polyelectrolytes, complexation is driven by a negative enthalpy due to electrostatic attraction between two oppositely charged chains, with counterion release entropy playing only a subsidiary role. In the strong interaction regime, complexation is driven by a large counterion release entropy and opposed by a positive enthalpy change. The addition of salt reduces the enthalpy of polyelectrolyte complexation by screening electrostatic interaction at all Coulomb interaction strengths. The counterion release entropy also decreases in the presence of salt, but the reduction only becomes significant at higher Coulomb interaction strengths. More significantly, in the range of Coulomb interaction strengths appropriate for highly charged polymers in aqueous solutions, complexation enthalpy depends weakly on salt concentration and counterion release entropy exhibits a large variation as a function of salt concentration. Our study quantitatively establishes that polyelectrolyte complexation in highly charged Coulomb systems is of entropic origin. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {In this thesis I present a novel coarse-grained model of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The model represents single-stranded DNA as a chain of rigid nu- cleotides, and includes potentials to represent chain connectivity, excluded vol- ume, hydrogen-bonding and base stacking interactions. The parameterization of these interactions is justified by comparing the model's representation of a range of physical phenomena to experimental data. In particular, the geometrical structure and elastic moduli of duplex DNA, and the flexibility of single-stranded DNA, are shown to be physically reasonable. Additionally, the thermodynamics of single-stranded stacking, duplex hybridization, hairpin formation and more complex motifs are shown to agree well with experimental data. The model is optimized for capturing the thermodynamic and mechanical changes associated with duplex formation from single strands. Considerable attention is therefore given to ensuring that single-stranded DNA behaves physically, an approach which differs from previous attempts to model DNA. As a result, the model is the first in which an explicit stacking transition is present in single strands, and also the only coarse-grained model to date to capture both hairpin formation within a single strand and duplex formation between strands. The scope of the model is demonstrated by simulating DNA tweezers, an iconic nanodevice {\textendash} the first time that coarse-grained modelling has been applied to dynamic DNA nanotechnology. The simulations suggest that branch migra- tion during toehold-mediated strand displacement {\textendash} a central feature of many nanomachines {\textendash} does not have a flat free-energy profile, as is generally assumed. This finding may help to explain the observed dependence of displacement rate on toehold length. Finally, the operation of a two-footed DNA walker on a single-stranded DNA track is considered. The model suggests that several aspects of the walker will reduce its efficiency, including a tendency to bind to an undesired site on the track. Several design modifications are suggested to improve the operation of the walker.},

To improve sequencing accuracy further, new models are continuously proposed. However, benchmarking is currently not standardized, and evaluation metrics and datasets used are defined on a per publication basis, impeding progress in the field. To standardize the process of benchmarking, we unified existing benchmarking datasets and defined a rigorous set of evaluation metrics. We benchmarked the latest seven basecaller models and analyzed their deep learning architectures. Our results show that overall Bonito has the best architecture for basecalling. We find, however, that species bias in training can have a large impact on performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of 90 novel architecture demonstrates that different models excel at reducing different types of errors and using RNNs (LSTM) and a CRF decoder are the main drivers of high performing models.},

  abstract = {Liquid-liquid phase separation, driven by collective interactions among multivalent and intrinsically disordered proteins, is thought to mediate the formation of membrane-less organelles in cells. Using parallel cellular and in~vitro assays, we show that the Nephrin intracellular domain (NICD), a disordered protein, drives intracellular phase separation via complex coacervation, whereby the negatively charged NICD co-assembles with positively charged partners to form protein-rich dense liquid droplets. Mutagenesis reveals that the driving force for phase separation depends on the overall amino acid composition and not the precise sequence of NICD. Instead, phase separation is promoted by one or more regions of high negative charge density and aromatic/hydrophobic residues that are distributed across the protein. Many disordered proteins share similar sequence characteristics with NICD, suggesting that complex coacervation may be a widely used mechanism to promote intracellular phase separation.},

Experiments, simulations, and theoretical approaches are still contributing novel insights to date, while no universal consensus on the statistical understanding of polymer translocation has been reached. We here collect the published results, in particular, the famous-infamous debate on the scaling exponents governing the translocation process. We put these results into perspective and discuss where the field is going. In particular, we argue that the phenomenon of polymer translocation is non-universal and highly sensitive to the exact specifications of the models and experiments used towards its analysis.

An alternative derivation of the Gibbs simulation criteria based on the limiting distributions for the appropriate statistical mechanical ensembles is presented. The method is then generalized for the calculation of phase equilibria of mixtures by simulation in a constant-pressure Gibbs ensemble and the calculation of equilibria across semipermeable membranes with an imposed osmotic pressure difference. The method is used to calculate phase equilibria for binary mixtures of Lennard-Jones molecules. Good agreement is found with published results obtained using other simulation techniques. The computer time required for the Gibbs method is only a small fraction of the corresponding requirement for previously available simulation techniques. Calculations for simple osmotic systems are performed for the first time by simulation, with results in agreement with exact theoretical predictions. {\textcopyright} 1988 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

The toroidal-shaped enzyme placed along the axis of the pore, threads a DNA molecule at a constant rate. As a result of this controlled release process, the length of DNA available for translocation varies with time. We examine the effect of time-dependent conformational entropy of the DNA on the translocation process. In addition, we also examine the effects of both the separation between the exonuclease and the pore, and the rate at which DNA is released by the enzyme. Our results indicate that the separation distance primarily influences the entry of the DNA into the pore. The length of the DNA released by the exonuclease that is most likely to enter the pore is nearly equal to separation distance between the pore and the exonuclease despite the flexibility of the polymer. However, the speed at which the DNA translocates through the nanopore is solely determined by the rate at which the exonuclease releases the DNA. We find that the translocation velocity is directly proportional to the rate of release. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

GCN-based models provide reliable prediction performances for the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), density ({$\rho$}), and elastic modulus (E) with substantial dependence on the dataset, which is the best for Tg (R2 {$\sim$} 0.9) and worst for E (R2 {$\sim$} 0.5). It is found that the GCN representations for polymers provide prediction performances of their properties comparable to the popular extended-connectivity circular fingerprint (ECFP) representation. Notably, the GCN combined with the neural network regression (GCN-NN) slightly outperforms the ECFP. It is investigated how the GCN captures important structural features of polymers to learn their properties. Using the dimensionality reduction, we demonstrate that the polymers are organized in the principal subspace of the GCN representation spaces with respect to the backbone rigidity. The organization in the representation space adaptively changes with the training and through the NN layers, which might facilitate a subsequent prediction of target properties based on the relationships between the structure and the property. The GCN models are found to provide an advantage to automatically extract a backbone rigidity, strongly correlated with Tg, as well as a potential transferability to predict other properties associated with a backbone rigidity. Our results indicate both the capability and limitations of the GCN in learning to describe polymer systems depending on the property.},

The passage of DNA through nanopores has so far been conjectured to involve a free-energy barrier for entry, followed by a downhill translocation where the driving voltage accelerates the polymer. We have tested the validity of this conjecture by using two toxins, a-hemolysin and aerolysin, which differ in their shape, size, and charge. The characteristic timescales in each toxin as a function of temperature show that the entry barrier is \${\textbackslash}sim\$15kBTand the translocation barrier is \${\textbackslash}sim\$35kBT, although the electrical force in the latter step is much stronger. Resolution of this fact, using a theoretical model, reveals that the attraction between DNA and the charges inside the barrel of the pore is the most dominant factor in determining the translocation speed and not merely the driving electrochemical potential gradient.},

Nanopore sequencers output FAST5 files containing signal data subsequently base called to FASTQ format. Optionally, ONT devices can collect data from all sequencing channels simultaneously in a bulk FAST5 file enabling inspection of signal in any channel at any point. We sought to visualize this signal to inspect challenging or difficult to sequence samples. Results: The BulkVis tool can load a bulk FAST5 file and overlays MinKNOW (the software that controls ONT sequencers) classifications on the signal trace and can show mappings to a reference. Users can navigate to a channel and time or, given a FASTQ header from a read, jump to its specific position. BulkVis can export regions as Nanopore base caller compatible reads. Using BulkVis, we find long reads can be incorrectly divided by MinKNOW resulting in single DNA molecules being split into two or more reads. The longest seen to date is 2 272 580 bases in length and reported in eleven consecutive reads. We provide helper scripts that identify and reconstruct split reads given a sequencing summary file and alignment to a reference. We note that incorrect read splitting appears to vary according to input sample type and is more common in'ultra-long' read preparations.},

As knowledge accumulates, the inherent bias of human intuition makes it harder to elucidate increasingly opaque chemical and physical principles. Moreover, given the limited manual and intellectual throughput of investigators, these principles cannot be efficiently applied to design new materials across a vast chemical space. Many data-driven approaches, following advances in high-throughput capabilities and machine learning, have tackled these limitations. In this Review, we compare traditional, human-centred methods with state-of-the-art, data-driven approaches to molecular and materials discovery. We first introduce the limitations of human-centred Edisonian, model-system and descriptor-based approaches. We then discuss how data-driven approaches can address these limitations by promoting throughput, reducing cognitive overload and biases, and establishing atomistic understanding that is transferable across a broad chemical space. We examine how high-throughput capabilities can be combined with active learning and inverse design to efficiently optimize materials out of millions or an intractable number of candidates. Lastly, we pinpoint challenges to accelerate future workflows and ultimately enable self-driving platforms, which automate and streamline the optimization of molecules and materials in iterative cycles.},

Our simulations reveal many intricate details of the substitution reaction in terms of conformational changes of the chains and competition between the invading chain and the chain being displaced for the common complementary chain. We show that the invading chain is required to be sufficiently longer than the chain being displaced for effecting the substitution. Yet, having the invading chain to be longer than a certain threshold value does not reduce the substitution time much further. While most of the simulations were carried out in salt-free conditions, we show that presence of salt facilitates the substitution reaction and reduces the substitution time. Analysis of our data shows that the dominant driving force for the substitution process involving polyelectrolytes lies in the release of counterions during the substitution.},

The result is a new global log- bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co- occurrence matrix, rather than on the en- tire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model pro- duces a vector space with meaningful sub- structure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task.

The advent of sequence-defined polymers gives rise to opportunities for material design, with increasing levels of chemical information being incorporated into long-chain molecules; however, this also raises questions that polymer physics must address. What properties uniquely emerge from sequence-definition? Is this circumstance-dependent? How do we define and think about sequence dispersity? How do we think about a hierarchy of sequence effects?

Fluid complexes occur when at least one of the polypeptides in the mixture is racemic, which disrupts backbone hydrogen-bonding networks. Pairs of purely chiral polypeptides, of any sense, form compact, fibrillar solids with a {$\beta$}-sheet structure. Analogous behaviour occurs in micelles formed from polypeptide block copolymers with polyethylene oxide, where assembly into aggregates with either solid or fluid cores, and eventually into ordered phases at high concentrations, is possible. Chirality is an exploitable tool for manipulating material properties in polyelectrolyte complexation.},

  abstract = {Complex coacervation is an electrostatically-driven phase separation phenomenon that is utilized in a wide range of everyday applications and is of great interest for the creation of self-assembled materials. Here, we utilized turbidity to characterize the effect of salt type on coacervate formation using two vinyl polyelectrolytes, poly(acrylic acid sodium salt) (pAA) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (pAH), as simple models for industrial and biological coacervates. We confirmed the dominant role of salt valence on the extent of coacervate formation, while demonstrating the presence of significant secondary effects, which can be described by Hofmeister-like behavior. These results revealed the importance of ion-specific interactions, which are crucial for the informed design of coacervate-based materials for use in complex ionic environments, and can enable more detailed theoretical investigations on the role of subtle electrostatic and thermodynamic effects in complex coacervation.},

  abstract = {NAMD is a molecular dynamics program designed for high-performance simulations of very large biological objects on CPU- and GPU-based architectures. NAMD offers scalable performance on petascale parallel supercomputers consisting of hundreds of thousands of cores, as well as on inexpensive commodity clusters commonly found in academic environments. It is written in C++ and leans on Charm++ parallel objects for optimal performance on low-latency architectures. NAMD is a versatile, multipurpose code that gathers state-of-the-art algorithms to carry out simulations in apt thermodynamic ensembles, using the widely popular CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS, and GROMOS biomolecular force fields. Here, we review the main features of NAMD that allow both equilibrium and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with numerical efficiency. We describe the underlying concepts utilized by NAMD and their implementation, most notably for handling long-range electrostatics; controlling the temperature, pressure, and pH; applying external potentials on tailored grids; leveraging massively parallel resources in multiple-copy simulations; and hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical descriptions. We detail the variety of options offered by NAMD for enhanced-sampling simulations aimed at determining free-energy differences of either alchemical or geometrical transformations and outline their applicability to specific problems. Last, we discuss the roadmap for the development of NAMD and our current efforts toward achieving optimal performance on GPU-based architectures, for pushing back the limitations that have prevented biologically realistic billion-atom objects to be fruitfully simulated, and for making large-scale simulations less expensive and easier to set up, run, and analyze. NAMD is distributed free of charge with its source code at www.ks.uiuc.edu.},

  abstract = {Multivalent counterion-induced bridging interactions have been identified as the key mechanism of drastic collapse of the height of polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes. In this article, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the bridging interactions in PE brushes for counterions of different sizes and valences. We identify that unlike the current notion, bridging interactions are not the sole function of the counterion valence. Rather the bridging interactions depend on the fraction of counterions (of a given type) that get physically condensed on the PE backbone as well as the size of the counterion solvation shell. These mechanisms ensure that certain monovalent counterions demonstrate much stronger bridging interactions than those witnessed for certain divalent and trivalent counterions, while certain counterions of identical valences show drastically different bridging interactions. We argue that these counterion-specific bridging interactions eventually enable not only the significant reduction of the PE brush height in the presence of certain multivalent screening counterions but may also give rise to scenarios where the brush height reduction for certain monovalent counterions is larger than that observed for certain divalent and trivalent counterions. The latter observation contradicts the experimental findings where the multivalent counterions invariably led to a larger decrease in the height of the PE brushes; we argue that this discrepancy stems from the fact that in our simulations we only consider densely grafted and short (and hence less flexible) PE brushes that hinder the formation of different laterally inhomogeneous structures (such as pinned micelles and cylindrical bundles) that would have led to a larger brush height reduction (in experiments, which invariably consider longer and less densely grafted brushes, the formation of such inhomogeneous structures is primarily responsible for the larger brush height reduction in the presence of multivalent counterions). Finally, we also probe the dynamic properties of the counterions (i.e., their time-dependent displacements) and their bridging interactions (i.e., lifetime of bridging interactions).},

Dynamic light scattering measurements indicate the presence of distinct fast and slow diffusive modes, where the fast mode is interpreted as a collective diffusion coefficient and the slow mode is attributed to the diffusion of multi-chain dynamic clusters. The relative population of fast and slow modes varies systematically with temperature and concentration. A clustering temperature (T*) was assigned when the slow mode first appeared upon cooling. The slow mode then increases in relative scattering amplitude as the phase boundary is approached. The fast mode exhibits a concentration dependence above T* consistent with the virial expansion in the collective diffusion. The sign~of the virial coefficient (kd) is negative, even in the good solvent region above the expected Flory temperature ({$\Theta$} {$\approx$} 39~{\textdegree}C), a behavior distinct from synthetic neutral polymers in organic solvents. The onset of multi-chain clustering at T \&lt; T* coincides with the poor solvent regime (T \&lt; {$\Theta$}). Attractive dipolar interactions due to the zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups in pAPAPS are suggested as the origin of the multi-chain clusters with no salt. Upon the addition of 100 mM NaCl, the slow mode is suppressed, and the hydrodynamic radius is consistent with polyzwitterion chain dimensions in a dilute solution. We find that concentration dependent diffusion is highly linked to the theta temperature and the emergence of dynamic clusters as the polymer goes from good to poor solvent on approach to the UCST. The slow mode in the semidilute regime is reported along with preliminary small-angle neutron scattering data that show salt reduces clustering and leads to predominantly chain scattering.},

Here, we analyze the sensitivity of the mapping to atomic displacements, showing that the combination of symmetry and smoothness leads to mappings that have singular points at which the Jacobian has one or more null singular values (besides those corresponding to infinitesimal translations and rotations). This is in fact desirable, because it enforces physical symmetry constraints on the values predicted by regression models constructed using such representations. However, besides these symmetry-induced singularities, there are also spurious singular points, that we find to be linked to the incompleteness of the mapping, i.e. the fact that, for certain classes of representations, structurally distinct configurations are not guaranteed to be mapped onto different feature vectors. Additional singularities can be introduced by a too aggressive truncation of the infinite basis set that is used to discretize the representations.},

Phase separation and complex coacervation of polypeptides are investigated in this study. Polypeptides have identical backbones and differ only in their charged side groups, making them attractive model systems for this work. All experiments are conducted using equal chain lengths of polycation and polyanion in order to isolate and highlight effects of the interactions of the charged groups during complexation. Complex coacervation is strongly affected by the polypeptide mixing ratio (stoichiometry), ionic strength (salt concentration), total polymer concentration, pH, and temperature. To examine the effect of these parameters on complex formation we use sample turbidity as an indicator, and optical microscopy to discriminate between coacervate and precipitate. We establish phase diagrams as a function of polybase content and salt concentration using the critical salt concentrations required to reach the coacervate to solution boundary. Additionally, we examine the effect of molecular weight on the complex formation for the P(L-Lysine) (PLys)/P(L-Glutamic acid) (PGlu) system and establish a phase diagram. By determining the water content of the coacervate phase under various conditions we find that the salt content and stoichiometry of the mixed polyelectrolytes have a significant effect on the coacervate composition.},

  abstract = {The interactions between a series of oppositely charged polypeptide pairs are probed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in combination with turbidity measurements and optical microscopy. Polypeptide complex coacervation is described as a sequence of two distinct binding steps using an empirical extension of a simple ITC binding model. The first step consists of the formation of soluble complexes from oppositely charged polypeptides (ion pairing), which in turn aggregate into insoluble interpolymer complexes in the second step (complex coacervation). Polypeptides have identical backbones and differ only in their charged side groups, making them attractive model systems for this work. The poly(l-ornithine hydrobromide) (PO)/poly(l-glutamic acid sodium salt) (PGlu) system is used to examine the effects of parameters such as the salt concentration, pH, temperature, degree of polymerization, and total polymer concentration on the thermodynamic characteristics of complexation. Complex coacervation in all probed systems is found to be endothermic, essentially an entropy-driven processes. Increasing the screening effect of the salt on the polyelectrolyte charges diminishes their propensity to interact, leading to a decrease in the observed energy change and coacervate quantity. The pH plays an important role in complex formation through its effect on the degree of ionization of the functional groups. Plotting the change in enthalpy with temperature allows the calculation of the heat capacity change ({$\Delta$}Cp) for the PO/PGlu interactions. Finally, ITC revealed that complex coacervation is promoted when higher total polymer concentrations or polypeptide chain lengths are used.},

In quantum mechanics, the objectivity of observations is not so clear, most dramatically exposed in Eugene Wigner's eponymous thought experiment where two observers can experience fundamentally different realities. While observer-independence has long remained inaccessible to empirical investigation, recent no-go-theorems construct an extended Wigner's friend scenario with four entangled observers that allows us to put it to the test. In a state-of-the-art 6-photon experiment, we here realise this extended Wigner's friend scenario, experimentally violating the associated Bell-type inequality by 5 standard deviations. This result lends considerable strength to interpretations of quantum theory already set in an observer-dependent framework and demands for revision of those which are not.},

  abstract = {Nanopores have been explored as highly sensitive sensors for detection and rapid sequencing of single molecules of DNA. To sequence DNA with a nanopore requires that adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G) produce distinct current signals as they traverse the pore. Recently, we demonstrated that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, and thymine immobilized in the nanopore protein {$\alpha$}-hemolysin ({$\alpha$}HL) produced distinct current blockades dependent on their chemical orientation. To probe the detection limit of {$\alpha$}HL, we examined immobilized single strands of T40 DNA (polyT) with single base substitutions of A, C, and G at 12 positions on the strand occupying the stem region of aHL. We find blockade currents sensitive to base identity over most of these positions with the most sensitive region near the pore constriction. Adenine substitutions increase the measured blockade current to values intermediate to the polyT and polyA currents at a number of positions, while C substitutions increase the current to a level intermediate to polyT and polyC values in some positions, but decrease it below polyT in others. These changes in blockade current were also observed for G substitutions. These results indicate that total blockade currents measured in aHL arise from nucleotides at multiple locations and thus are not uniquely attributable to an individual base in a specific position, a finding consistent with a recently published study. The measurements of C and G substitutions also suggest that blockade current may be modulated through interactions between nucleotides and the pore interior at multiple sites in {$\alpha$}HL. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Helicases and remodeling enzymes are ATP-dependent motor proteins that play a critical role in every aspect of RNA and DNA metabolism. Most RNA-remodeling enzymes are members of helicase superfamily 2 (SF2), which includes many DNA helicase enzymes that display similar structural and mechanistic features. Although SF2 enzymes are typically called helicases, many of them display other types of functions, including single-strand translocation, strand annealing, and protein displacement. There are two mechanisms by which RNA helicase enzymes unwind RNA: The nonprocessive DEAD group catalyzes local unwinding of short duplexes adjacent to their binding sites. Members of the processive DExH group often translocate along single-stranded RNA and displace paired strands (or proteins) in their path. In the latter case, unwinding is likely to occur by an active mechanism that involves Brownian motor function and stepwise translocation along RNA. Through structural and single-molecule investigations, researchers are developing coherent models to explain the functions and dynamic motions of helicase enzymes.

  abstract = {Molecular image recognition is a fundamental task in information extraction from chemistry literature. Previous data-driven models formulate it as an image-to-sequence task, to generate a sequential representation of the molecule (e.g. SMILES string) from its graphical representation. Although they perform adequately on certain benchmarks, these models are not robust in real-world situations, where molecular images differ in style, quality, and chemical patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation approach that explicitly predicts atoms and bonds, along with their geometric layouts, to construct the molecular graph. We develop data augmentation strategies for molecules and images to increase the robustness of our model against domain shifts. Our model is flexible to incorporate chemistry constraints, and produces more interpretable predictions than SMILES. In experiments on both synthetic and realistic molecular images, our model significantly outperforms previous models, achieving 84-93\% accuracy on five benchmarks. We also conduct human evaluation and show that our model reduces the time for a chemist to extract molecular structures from images by roughly 50\%.},

This principle has been implemented in portable sequencers that use enzymes to move DNA or RNA through hundreds of individual nanopore detectors positioned in an array. Nevertheless, its application to the sequencing of other biopolymers, including polypeptides and polysaccharides, has not progressed because suitable enzymes are lacking. Recently, we devised a purely chemical means to move molecules processively in steps comparable to the repeat distances in biopolymers. Here, with this chemical approach, we demonstrate sequential nucleobase identification during DNA translocation through a nanopore. Further, the relative location of a guanine modification with a chemotherapeutic platinum derivative is pinpointed with single-base resolution. After further development, chemical translocation might replace stepping by enzymes for highly parallel single-molecule biopolymer sequencing.},

Understanding helicase mechanism requires that the basic physicochemical process of base pair separation be understood. This necessitates monitoring helicase activity directly, at high spatio-temporal resolution. Using optical tweezers with single base pair (bp) resolution, we analyzed DNA unwinding by XPD helicase, a Superfamily 2 (SF2) DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and transcription initiation. We show that monomeric XPD unwinds duplex DNA in 1-bp steps, yet exhibits frequent backsteps and undergoes conformational transitions manifested in 5-bp backward and forward steps. Quantifying the sequence dependence of XPD stepping dynamics with near base pair resolution, we provide the strongest and most direct evidence thus far that forward, single-base pair stepping of a helicase utilizes the spontaneous opening of the duplex. The proposed unwinding mechanism may be a universal feature of DNA helicases that move along DNA phosphodiester backbones. {\textcopyright} Qi et al.},

  abstract = {Background: Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. Results: We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. Conclusions: Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices.},

  abstract = {The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record, responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299 deaths. Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87 {\texttimes} 10-3 and 1.42 {\texttimes} 10-3 mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min. We show that real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.},

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any ex- plicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText.

The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and in- creasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested lan- guage modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain co- herent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language pro- cessing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

  abstract = {Our ability to predict the thermodynamic phase behavior of a material system is a direct reflection on our understanding of the relevant interactions. Voorn{\textendash}Overbeek (VO) theory, which combines Flory{\textendash}Huggins polymer mixing with Debye{\textendash}Huckel electrostatics, has been used to describe the associative liquid{\textendash}liquid phase separation phenomenon known as complex coacervation since the 1950s. The long-standing utility of this theory stems from its simplicity coupled with its apparent agreement with physical systems. VO theory has also served as the starting point for a large class of field theories that predict similar phase behaviors. Recent work using new hybrid simulation methods demonstrates novel coacervate-driven self-assembly is strongly affected by molecular details. Liquid state (LS) theory suggests there are fundamental reasons for this observation and that agreement between VO and experiment is fortuitous. It is hypothesized that VO/experimental matching is due to a cancellation of errors arising from the neglect of monomer-level charge connectivity and excluded volume effects. In this article, we use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to confirm the earlier predictions from LS theory. We directly observe effects related to connectivity-driven charge correlations. We also observe strong exclusion of salt from the polymer-rich coacervate phase, in direct opposition with VO theory and in near quantitative agreement with experimental results. Strikingly, a comparison of predicted phase diagrams using identical system parameters shows that VO overpredicts coacervate phase behavior and that previous agreement with experiments was likely due to the use of unphysical fitting parameters. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms driving complex coacervation and shows promise for predicting coacervate phase behavior based on resolving molecular level charge structure.},

Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, we design network design spaces that parametrize populations of networks. The overall process is analogous to classic manual design of networks, but elevated to the design space level. Using our methodology we explore the structure aspect of network design and arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call RegNet. The core insight of the RegNet parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network design. The RegNet design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. Under comparable training settings and flops, the RegNet models outperform the popular EfficientNet models while being up to 5{\texttimes} faster on GPUs.},

However, large uncharted territories persist due to its size scaling combinatorially with molecular size. We report computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF. These molecules correspond to the subset of all 133,885 species with up to nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17 chemical universe of 166 billion organic molecules. We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry. Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.},

  abstract = {The molecular processes that contribute to degenerative diseases are not well understood. Recent observations suggest that some degenerative diseases are promoted by the accumulation of nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA-protein (RNP) aggregates, which can be related to endogenous RNP granules. RNP aggregates arise commonly in degenerative diseases because RNA-binding proteins commonly self-assemble, in part through prion-like domains, which can form self-propagating amyloids. RNP aggregates may be toxic due to multiple perturbations of posttranscriptional control, thereby disrupting the normal ``ribostasis'' of the cell. This suggests that understanding and modulating RNP assembly or clearance may be effective approaches to developing therapies for these diseases.},

Seventeen simulations, with different water-to-silicon ratios and silicic acid concentrations, were each run for between 1.6 and 12.5 ns, at temperatures of 1500,2000, and 2500 K. Water clearly acts as a catalyst in these simulations. When the water-to-silicon ratio is large, we find that the initial stages of the polymerization process are dominated by the conversion of monomers to dimers and addition of monomers to small clusters, while at longer times cluster-cluster aggregation is observed. Using data from simulations at different temperatures, the activation energies of condensation between silicic acid monomers were calculated at different water-to-silicon ratios and found to compare favorably with experimental results; an extrapolation (at constant density) of simulated reaction rates to ambient conditions (a temperature difference of more than 1200 K) agrees with experimental rates to within one order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Weak polyelectrolytes are relevant for a wide range of fields; in particular, they have been investigated as ``smart'' materials for chemical separations and drug delivery. The charges on weak polyelectrolytes are dynamic, causing polymer chains to adopt different equilibrium conformations even with relatively small changes to the surrounding environment. Currently, there exists no comprehensive picture of this behavior, particularly where polymer{\textendash}polymer interactions have the potential to affect charging properties significantly. In this study, we elucidate the novel interplay between weak polyelectrolyte charging and complexation behavior through coupled molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate a model of two equal-length and oppositely charging polymer chains in an implicit salt solution represented through Debye{\textendash}H{\"u}ckel interactions. The charging tendency of each chain, along with the salt concentration, is varied to determine the existence and extent of cooperativity in charging and complexation. Strong cooperation in the charging of these chains is observed at large Debye lengths, corresponding to low salt concentrations, while at lower Debye lengths (higher salt concentrations), the chains behave in apparent isolation. When the electrostatic coupling is long-ranged, we find that a highly charged chain strongly promotes the charging of its partner chain, even if the environment is unfavorable for an isolated version of that partner chain. Evidence of this phenomenon is supported by a drop in the potential energy of the system, which does not occur at the lower Debye lengths where both potential energies and charge fractions converge for all partner chain charging tendencies. The discovery of this cooperation will be helpful in developing ``smart'' drug delivery mechanisms by allowing for better predictions for the dissociation point of delivery complexes.},

To resolve the most complex repeats, this project relied on manual integration of ultra-long Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads with a high-resolution assembly graph built from long, accurate PacBio HiFi reads. We have improved and automated this strategy in Verkko, an iterative, graph-based pipeline for assembling complete, diploid genomes. Verkko begins with a multiplex de Bruijn graph built from long, accurate reads and progressively simplifies this graph via the integration of ultra-long reads and haplotype-specific markers. The result is a phased, diploid assembly of both haplotypes, with many chromosomes automatically assembled from telomere to telomere. Running Verkko on the HG002 human genome resulted in 20 of 46 diploid chromosomes assembled without gaps at 99.9997\% accuracy. The complete assembly of diploid genomes is a critical step towards the construction of comprehensive pangenome databases and chromosome-scale comparative genomics.},

  abstract = {Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536\,km\,{\texttimes}\,1,280\,km and with lead times from 5{\textendash}90\,min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

However, the impressive accuracy numbers of the best performing models are questionable because the same test sets have been used to select these models for multiple years now. To understand the danger of overfitting, we measure the accuracy of CIFAR-10 classifiers by creating a new test set of truly unseen images. Although we ensure that the new test set is as close to the original data distribution as possible, we find a large drop in accuracy (4\% to 10\%) for a broad range of deep learning models. Yet more recent models with higher original accuracy show a smaller drop and better overall performance, indicating that this drop is likely not due to overfitting based on adaptivity. Instead, we view our results as evidence that current accuracy numbers are brittle and susceptible to even minute natural variations in the data distribution.},

An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features - using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3], our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

  abstract = {Disentangling the mechanistic details of a chemical reaction pathway is a hard problem that often requires a considerable amount of chemical intuition and a component of luck. Experiments struggle in observing short-life metastable intermediates, while computer simulations often rely upon a good initial guess. In this work, we propose a method that, from the simulations of a reactant and a product state, searches for reaction mechanisms connecting the two by exploring the configuration space through metadynamics, a well-known enhanced molecular dynamics method. The key quantity underlying this search is based on the use of an approach called harmonic linear discriminant analysis which allows a systematic construction of collective variables. Given the reactant and product states, we choose a set of descriptors capable of discriminating between the two states. In order to not prejudge the results, generic descriptors are introduced. The fluctuations of the descriptors in the two states are used to construct collective variables. We use metadynamics in an exploratory mode to discover the intermediates and the transition states that lead from reactant to product. The search is at first conducted at a low theory level. The calculation is then refined, and the energy of the intermediates and transition states discovered during metadynamics is computed again using a higher level of theory. The method's aim is to offer a simple reaction mechanism search procedure that helps in saving time and is able to find unexpected mechanisms that defy well established chemical paradigms. We apply it to two reactions, showing that a high level of complexity can be hidden even in seemingly trivial and small systems. The method can be applied to larger systems, such as reactions in solution or catalysis.},

Here, we show that the sequence and length of single-stranded DNA directly influence the self-assembly of sequence-defined DNA block copolymers. While increasing the length of DNA led to predictable changes in self-assembly, changing only the sequence of DNA produced three distinct structures: spherical micelles (spherical nucleic acids, SNAs) from flexible poly(thymine) DNA, fibers from semirigid mixed-sequence DNA, and networked superstructures from rigid poly(adenine) DNA. The secondary structure of poly(adenine) DNA strands drives a temperature-dependent polymerization and assembly mechanism: copolymers stored in an SNA reservoir form fibers after thermal activation, which then aggregate upon cooling to form interwoven networks. DNA is often used as a programming code that aids in nanostructure addressability and function. Here, we show that the inherent physical and chemical properties of single-stranded DNA sequences also make them an ideal material to direct self-assembled morphologies and select for new methods of supramolecular polymerization.},

Many articles have been published in 2020 describing new machine learning-based models for both of these tasks, but it is unclear which are of potential clinical utility. In this systematic review, we consider all published papers and preprints, for the period from 1 January 2020 to 3 October 2020, which describe new machine learning models for the diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 from CXR or CT images. All manuscripts uploaded to bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv along with all entries in EMBASE and MEDLINE in this timeframe are considered. Our search identified 2,212 studies, of which 415 were included after initial screening and, after quality screening, 62 studies were included in this systematic review. Our review finds that none of the models identified are of potential clinical use due to methodological flaws and/or underlying biases. This is a major weakness, given the urgency with which validated COVID-19 models are needed. To address this, we give many recommendations which, if followed, will solve these issues and lead to higher-quality model development and well-documented manuscripts.},

Self-driving laboratories have the potential to provide the means to revolutionize experimentation by empowering automation with artificial intelligence to enable autonomous discovery. However, the lack of adequate software solutions significantly impedes the development of selfdriving laboratories. In this paper, we make progress towards addressing this challenge, and we propose and develop an implementation of ChemOS; a portable, modular and versatile software package which supplies the structured layers necessary for the deployment and operation of self-driving laboratories. ChemOS facilitates the integration of automated equipment, and it enables remote control of automated laboratories. ChemOS can operate at various degrees of autonomy; from fully unsupervised experimentation to actively including inputs and feedbacks from researchers into the experimentation loop. The flexibility of ChemOS provides a broad range of functionality as demonstrated on five applications, which were executed on different automated equipment, highlighting various aspects of the software package.},

Recent advances in the sequence control of traditional copolymers, such as polyethylenes and polystyrenes, have led to well controlled primary structures ranging from periodic to more precise sequences. As a result, this unprecedented control in the chemical structure of the polymer has necessitated a reexamination of the role of monomer sequence on polymer properties, such as crystallization and self-assembly. In this review, we summarize the developments in establishing a relationship between a polymer's sequence and its properties, and we focus on one sequence-specific polymer system in particular: N-substituted glycines, or polypeptoids. Polypeptoid self-assembly has demonstrated remarkably tunable, hierarchical structures, and through this lens, we look to the future ``designability'' of sequence-specific polymers in general.},

One important avenue for scalable sequence-controlled polymers leverages the random copolymerization of distinct monomers, with the statistical distribution of the monomeric sequence arising from reaction kinetics following a first-order Markov process. Here we utilize the framework of the random phase approximation (RPA) to develop a theory for the phase behavior of symmetric polyelectrolyte coacervates whose chemical sequences are dictated by simple statistical distributions. We find that a high charge ``blockiness'' within the random sequences favors the formation of denser and more salt-resistant coacervates while simultaneously increasing the width of the two-phase region. We trace these physical effects to the increased cooperativity of Coulomb interactions that results from increased charge blockiness in oppositely charged polyelectrolytes.},

An analytical approach consistently describing both weak and strong correlations is proposed, which is based on the improvement of the random phase approximation (RPA) by taking into account (i) discreteness of charges in polymer chains and (ii) a finite number of wave modes of the charge density fluctuations. These modifications are an essential element of the particle-to-field transformation. For strong Coulomb interactions, the generalized RPA reproduces the free energy of the strongly correlated Wigner liquid of disjointed charges. The developed theory is applied to describe coil-to-globule transitions in single-chain polyampholytes as a function of the monomer sequence. Comparison with results of molecular simulations confirms that the theory reproduces the observed scaling laws for globule size at weak charge correlations, and in addition, it provides a quantitative description of electrostatic interactions when correlations are strong.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations can provide mechanistic insight into ionic liquids (ILs) and predict the properties of experimentally unrealized ion combinations. However, ILs suffer from a particularly large disparity in the time scales of atomistic and ensemble motion. Coarse-grained models are therefore used in place of costly atomistic simulations, allowing simulation of longer time scales and larger systems. Nevertheless, constructing the many-body potential of mean force that defines the structure and dynamics of a coarse-grained system can be complicated and computationally intensive. Machine learning shows great promise for the key coupled challenges of dimensionality reduction and learning the potential of mean force. To improve the coarse-graining of ILs, we present a neural network model trained on all-atom classical molecular dynamics simulations. The potential of mean force is expressed as two jointly-trained neural network interatomic potentials that learn the coupled short-range and the many-body long range molecular interactions. These interatomic potentials treat temperature as an explicit input variable to capture the temperature dependence of the potential of mean force. The model reproduces structural quantities with high fidelity, outperforms the temperature-independent baseline at capturing dynamics, generalizes to unseen temperatures, and incurs low simulation cost.},

The importance of each reaction is controlled by a corresponding chemistry-dependent standard free energy input parameter. Our model also accounts for Born (or ion solvation) energy using a linear mixing rule for the effective dielectric constant. In monophasic systems, the proposed model can qualitatively explain the observed shifts in acidity and basicity observed in potentiometric titration of weak PEs in the presence of salt and oppositely charged PEs in accordance with Le Ch{\^a}telier's principle. We demonstrate how a competition between counterion condensation (CC) and IP alone can explain the complex coacervation of strongly charged PEs as well as the existence of a critical salt concentration. Binodal diagrams predicted in our model are also affected by long-ranged electrostatics and are most sensitive to IP strength both for weak and strong PEs. The extent of IP increases in the dense phase at the expense of reduced CC upon coacervation consistent with counter release view of complex coacervation. We compare binodal diagrams predicted by our model against experimental data for both weakly and strongly dissociating polyions pairs and find a plausible parameter set that leads to an acceptable and partial agreement with experiments in the two cases, respectively.},

The reproducibility of computational aspects of research is a key component of scientific reproducibility but has not yet been assessed at scale for Jupyter notebooks associated with biomedical publications. We address computational reproducibility at two levels: First, using fully automated workflows, we analyzed the computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks related to publications indexed in PubMed Central. We identified such notebooks by mining the articles full text, locating them on GitHub and re-running them in an environment as close to the original as possible. We documented reproduction success and exceptions and explored relationships between notebook reproducibility and variables related to the notebooks or publications. Second, this study represents a reproducibility attempt in and of itself, using essentially the same methodology twice on PubMed Central over two years. Out of 27271 notebooks from 2660 GitHub repositories associated with 3467 articles, 22578 notebooks were written in Python, including 15817 that had their dependencies declared in standard requirement files and that we attempted to re-run automatically. For 10388 of these, all declared dependencies could be installed successfully, and we re-ran them to assess reproducibility. Of these, 1203 notebooks ran through without any errors, including 879 that produced results identical to those reported in the original notebook and 324 for which our results differed from the originally reported ones. Running the other notebooks resulted in exceptions. We zoom in on common problems, highlight trends and discuss potential improvements to Jupyter-related workflows associated with biomedical publications.},

In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generativemodels have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials. 2017},

  abstract = {Assessment of bacterial diversity through sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes has been an approach widely used in environmental microbiology, particularly since the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. An additional innovation introduced by these technologies was the need of developing new strategies to manage and investigate the massive amount of sequencing data generated. This situation stimulated the rapid expansion of the field of bioinformatics with the release of new tools to be applied to the downstream analysis and interpretation of sequencing data mainly generated using Illumina technology. In recent years, a third generation of sequencing technologies has been developed and have been applied in parallel and complementarily to the former sequencing strategies. In particular, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced nanopore sequencing which has become very popular among molecular ecologists. Nanopore technology offers a low price, portability and fast sequencing throughput. This powerful technology has been recently tested for 16S rRNA analyses showing promising results. However, compared with previous technologies, there is a scarcity of bioinformatic tools and protocols designed specifically for the analysis of Nanopore 16S sequences. Due its notable characteristics, researchers have recently started performing assessments regarding the suitability MinION on 16S rRNA sequencing studies, and have obtained remarkable results. Here we present a review of the state-of-the-art of MinION technology applied to microbiome studies, the current possible application and main challenges for its use on 16S rRNA metabarcoding.},

  abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called ``internal covariate shift''. In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

Method: Analysis of health data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey, and other sources. Findings and Conclusions: Various factors contribute to high per capita drug spending in the U.S. While drug utilization appears to be similar in the U.S. and the nine other countries considered, the prices at which drugs are sold in the U.S. are substantially higher. These price differences appear to at least partly explain current and historical disparities in spending on pharmaceutical drugs. U.S. consumers face particularly high out-of-pocket costs, both because the U.S. has a large uninsured population and because cost-sharing requirements for those with coverage are more burdensome than in other countries. Most Americans support reducing pharmaceutical costs. International experience demonstrates that policies like universal health coverage, insurance benefit design that restricts out-of-pocket spending, and certain price control strategies, like centralized price negotiations, can be effective.},

Although sweat secretion and ductal absorption are basically biophysical and biologic cellular processes, a detailed description of the basic biophysical principles of membrane transport has been avoided to make the discussion more readable. The cited references will, however, help those readers primarily interested in the basic details of sweat gland function. Part I of this article includes a discussion of morphologic characteristics, central and peripheral nervous control of sweat secretion, neurotransmitters, intracellular mediators and stimulus secretion coupling, Na-K-Cl cotransport model for the ionic mechanism of sweat secretion, ingredients of sweat, ductal function, the pathogenesis of abnormal sweat gland function in cystic fibrosis, and the discovery of the apoeccrine sweat gland. Part II, to be published in the May issue of the Journal, reviews reports of all those major disorders of hyperhidrosis and hypohidrosis that have appeared in the literature during the past 10 years. It is hoped that this review will serve as a resource for clinicians who encounter puzzling disorders of sweating in their patients, as well as for investigators who wish to obtain a quick update on sweat gland function.},

Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show that this measure returns non-zero values only when the graphs are non-isomorphic.

These models employ the full Euclidean space or a bounded subset as the latent space, whose flat geometry, however, is often too simplistic to meaningfully reflect the manifold structure of the data. In this work, we advocate the use of a multi-chart latent space for better data representation. Inspired by differential geometry, we propose a Chart Auto-Encoder (CAE) and prove a universal approximation theorem on its representation capability. We show that the training data size and the network size scale exponentially in approximation error with an exponent depending on the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold. CAE admits desirable manifold properties that auto-encoders with a flat latent space fail to obey, predominantly proximity of data. We conduct extensive experimentation with synthetic and real-life examples to demonstrate that CAE provides reconstruction with high fidelity, preserves proximity in the latent space, and generates new data remaining near the manifold. These experiments show that CAE is advantageous over existing auto-encoders and variants by preserving the topology of the data manifold as well as its geometry.},

  abstract = {The problem of retrosynthetic planning can be framed as a one-player game, in which the chemist (or a computer program) works backward from a molecular target to simpler starting materials through a series of choices regarding which reactions to perform. This game is challenging as the combinatorial space of possible choices is astronomical, and the value of each choice remains uncertain until the synthesis plan is completed and its cost evaluated. Here, we address this search problem using deep reinforcement learning to identify policies that make (near) optimal reaction choices during each step of retrosynthetic planning according to a user-defined cost metric. Using a simulated experience, we train a neural network to estimate the expected synthesis cost or value of any given molecule based on a representation of its molecular structure. We show that learned policies based on this value network can outperform a heuristic approach that favors symmetric disconnections when synthesizing unfamiliar molecules from available starting materials using the fewest number of reactions. We discuss how the learned policies described here can be incorporated into existing synthesis planning tools and how they can be adapted to changes in the synthesis cost objective or material availability.},

However, NN predictions are only reliable within well-learned training domains, and show volatile behavior when extrapolating. Uncertainty quantification approaches can flag atomic configurations for which prediction confidence is low, but arriving at such uncertain regions requires expensive sampling of the NN phase space, often using atomistic simulations. Here, we exploit automatic differentiation to drive atomistic systems towards high-likelihood, high-uncertainty configurations without the need for molecular dynamics simulations. By performing adversarial attacks on an uncertainty metric, informative geometries that expand the training domain of NNs are sampled. When combined to an active learning loop, this approach bootstraps and improves NN potentials while decreasing the number of calls to the ground truth method. This efficiency is demonstrated on sampling of kinetic barriers and collective variables in molecules, and can be extended to any NN potential architecture and materials system.},

By introducing a supercell-invariant metric that compares crystal structures using graph theory, we show that diffusionless (topotactic and reconstructive) transformations occur only between graph-similar pairs. Furthermore, all the known instances of intergrowth occur between either structurally similar or graph similar frameworks. We identify promising pairs to realize diffusionless transformations and intergrowth, with hundreds of low-distance pairs identified among known zeolites, and thousands of hypothetical frameworks connected to known zeolite counterparts.

  abstract = {Zeolites span a large variety of microporous crystal structures, making them useful materials for catalysis and separations. However, controlling phase competition in their synthesis often requires organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) to selectively crystallize the desired topologies. Whereas computational design of OSDAs can help in selecting adequate candidates for zeolite synthesis, machine-generated templates are often complex or expensive. In this work, we use shape and binding metrics to propose templates for over 100 zeolites and to rationalize dual-OSDA approaches. Starting from OSDAs from the literature, promising templates were selected for zeolites ranging from clathrasil frameworks to extra large-pore structures. Selectivity maps derived from phase competition metrics show that small- and medium-pore zeolites tend to be more shape-selective toward their templates than their large-pore counterparts. Finally, shape and volume descriptors allow identification of OSDAs that may act as synergistic pore-fillers for different cavities of zeolites. The application of this theory is demonstrated for the case of the KFI zeolite, which may be synthesized using tetraethylammonium and OSDAs repurposed from high-silica LTA synthesis as dual OSDAs. This work may help in the discovery of new synthesis routes for known zeolites using shape descriptors and repurposed OSDAs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The translation of genome sequencing into routine health care has been slow, partly because of concerns about affordability. The aspirational cost of sequencing a genome is \$1000, but there is little evidence to support this estimate. We estimate the cost of using genome sequencing in routine clinical care in patients with cancer or rare diseases. Methods: We performed a microcosting study of Illumina-based genome sequencing in a UK National Health Service laboratory processing 399 samples/year. Cost data were collected for all steps in the sequencing pathway, including bioinformatics analysis and reporting of results. Sensitivity analysis identified key cost drivers. Results: Genome sequencing costs {\textbackslash}pounds6841 per cancer case (comprising matched tumor and germline samples) and {\textbackslash}pounds7050 per rare disease case (three samples). The consumables used during sequencing are the most expensive component of testing (68{\textendash}72\% of the total cost). Equipment costs are higher for rare disease cases, whereas consumable and staff costs are slightly higher for cancer cases. Conclusion: The cost of genome sequencing is underestimated if only sequencing costs are considered, and likely surpasses \$1000/genome in a single laboratory. This aspirational sequencing cost will likely only be achieved if consumable costs are considerably reduced and sequencing is performed at scale.},

  abstract = {Peptide-RNA coacervates can result in the concentration and compartmentalization of simple biopolymers. Given their primordial relevance, peptide-RNA coacervates may have also been a key site of early protein evolution. However, the extent to which such coacervates might promote or suppress the exploration of novel peptide conformations is fundamentally unknown. To this end, we used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) to characterize the structure and dynamics of an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid binding element, the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, alone and in the presence of RNA, with which it forms coacervates. Double electron{\textendash}electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy applied to singly labeled peptides containing one HhH motif revealed the presence of dimers, even in the absence of RNA. Moreover, dimer formation is promoted upon RNA binding and was detectable within peptide-RNA coacervates. DEER measurements of spin-diluted, doubly labeled peptides in solution indicated transient {$\alpha$}-helical character. The distance distributions between spin labels in the dimer and the signatures of {$\alpha$}-helical folding are consistent with the symmetric (HhH)2-Fold, which is generated upon duplication and fusion of a single HhH motif and traditionally associated with dsDNA binding. These results support the hypothesis that coacervates are a unique testing ground for peptide oligomerization and that phase-separating peptides could have been a resource for the construction of complex protein structures via common evolutionary processes, such as duplication and fusion.},

By computational analysis of archaeal genomes we detected putative H/ACA sRNAs, in four Sulfolobales species and in Aeropyrum pernix, that might guide Psi 35 formation in pre-tRNA(Tyr)(GUA). This modification is achieved by Pus7p in eukarya. The validity of the computational predictions was verified by in vitro reconstitution of H/ACA sRNPs using the identified Sulfolobus solfataricus H/ACA sRNA. Comparison of Pus7-like enzymes encoded by archaeal genomes revealed amino acid substitutions in motifs IIIa and II in Sulfolobales and A. pernix Pus7-like enzymes. These conserved RNA:Psi-synthase- motifs are essential for catalysis. As expected, the recombinant Pyrococcus abyssi aPus7 was fully active and acted at positions 35 and 13 and other positions in tRNAs, while the recombinant S. solfataricus aPus7 was only found to have a poor activity at position 13. We showed that the presence of an A residue 3' to the target U residue is required for P. abyssi aPus7 activity, and that this is not the case for the reconstituted S. solfataricus H/ACA sRNP. In agreement with the possible formation of Psi 35 in tRNA(Tyr)(GUA) by aPus7 in P. abyssi and by an H/ACA sRNP in S. solfataricus, the A36G mutation in the P. abyssi tRNA(Tyr)(GUA) abolished Psi 35 formation when using P. abyssi extract, whereas the A36G substitution in the S. solfataricus pre-tRNA(Tyr) did not affect Psi 35 formation in this RNA when using an S. solfataricus extract.},

While the well-known Wulff construction can accurately capture the equilibrium shape of large colloidal assemblies, containing O(104) or more particles, determining the equilibrium shape of small colloidal assemblies of O(10) particles requires a generalized Wulff construction technique which we have developed for a proper description of equilibrium structure and morphology of small crystals.

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13) {\textemdash} a blind assessment of the state of the field {\textemdash} AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined.},

We report several important aspects of the capture process and subsequent translocation of a model DNA polymer through a solid-state nanopore in the presence of an extended electric field using the Brownian dynamics simulation that enables us to record statistics of the conformations at every stage of the translocation process. By releasing the equilibrated DNAs from different equipotentials, we observe that the capture time distribution depends on the initial starting point and follows a Poisson process. The field gradient elongates the DNA on its way toward the nanopore and favors a successful translocation even after multiple failed threading attempts. Even in the limit of an extremely narrow pore, a fully flexible chain has a finite probability of hairpin-loop capture, while this probability decreases for a stiffer chain and promotes single file translocation. Our in silico studies identify and differentiate characteristic distributions of the mean first passage time due to single file translocation from those due to translocation of different types of folds and provide direct evidence of the interpretation of the experimentally observed folds [M. Gershow and J. A. Golovchenko, Nat. Nanotechnol. 2, 775 (2007) and Mihovilovic et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 028102 (2013)] in a solitary nanopore.

Third-generation nanopore sequence data have demonstrated a long read length, but current interpretation methods for their novel pore-based signal have unique error profiles, making accurate analysis challenging. Here, we introduce a haplotype-aware variant calling pipeline, PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant, that produces state-of-the-art variant calling results with nanopore data. We show that our nanopore-based method outperforms the short-read-based single-nucleotide-variant identification method at the whole-genome scale and produces high-quality single-nucleotide variants in segmental duplications and low-mappability regions where short-read-based genotyping fails. We show that our pipeline can provide highly contiguous phase blocks across the genome with nanopore reads, contiguously spanning between 85\% and 92\% of annotated genes across six samples. We also extend PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant to PacBio HiFi data, providing an efficient solution with superior performance over the current WhatsHap-DeepVariant standard. Finally, we demonstrate de novo assembly polishing methods that use nanopore and PacBio HiFi reads to produce diploid assemblies with high accuracy (Q35+\,nanopore-polished and Q40+\,PacBio HiFi-polished).},

  abstract = {Quantitative free energy computation involves both using a model that is sufficiently faithful to the experimental system under study (accuracy) and establishing statistically meaningful measures of the uncertainties resulting from finite sampling (precision). We use large-scale distributed computing to access sufficient computational resources to extensively sample molecular systems and thus reduce statistical uncertainty of measured free energies. In order to examine the accuracy of a range of common models used for protein simulation, we calculate the free energy of hydration of 15 amino acid side chain analogs derived from recent versions of the OPLS-AA, CHARMM, and AMBER parameter sets in TIP3P water using thermodynamic integration. We achieve a high degree of statistical precision in our simulations, obtaining uncertainties for the free energy of hydration of 0.02{\textendash}0.05 kcal/mol, which are in general an order of magnitude smaller than those found in other studies. Notably, this level of precision is comparable to that obtained in experimental hydration free energy measurements of the same molecules. Root mean square differences from experiment over the set of molecules examined using AMBER-, CHARMM-, and OPLS-AA-derived parameters were 1.35 kcal/mol, 1.31 kcal/mol, and 0.85 kcal/mol, respectively. Under the simulation conditions used, these force fields tend to uniformly underestimate solubility of all the side chain analogs. The relative free energies of hydration between amino acid side chain analogs were closer to experiment but still exhibited significant deviations. Although extensive computational resources may be needed for large numbers of molecules, sufficient computational resources to calculate precise free energy calculations for small molecules are accessible to most researchers.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular condensates formed through the phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids are widely observed, offering a fundamental means of organizing intracellular materials in a membrane-less fashion. Traditionally, these condensates have been regarded as homogeneous isotropic liquids. However, in analogy with some synthetic copolymer systems, our recent theoretical research has demonstrated that model biomolecular condensates can exhibit a microemulsion-like internal structure, contingent upon the specific sequence, inter-chain site-site interactions, and concentrated phase polymer density. In this study, we present a microscopic dynamical theory for the self-diffusion constant and viscosity of concentrated unentangled A/B regular multiblock copolymer solutions. Our approach integrates static equilibrium local and microdomain scale structural information obtained from PRISM integral equation theory and the time evolution of the autocorrelation function of monomer scale forces at the center-of-mass level that determine the polymer diffusion constant and viscosity in a weak caging regime far from a glass or gel transition. We focus on regular multi-block systems both for simplicity and for its relevance to synthetic macromolecular science. The impact of sequence and inter-chain attraction strength on the slowing down of copolymer mass transport and flow due to local clustering enhanced collisional friction and retardation of motion due to emergent microdomain scale ordering are established. Analytic analysis and metrics employed in the study of biomolecular condensates are employed to identify key order parameters that quantity how attractive forces, packing structure, multiblock sequence, and copolymer density determine dynamical slowing down above and below the crossover to a fluctuating polymeric microemulsion state.},

Self-assembled nanoaggregates formed from {$\pi$}-conjugated oligopeptides composed of an aromatic core flanked by oligopeptide wings offer emergent optoelectronic properties within a water-soluble and biocompatible substrate. Nanoaggregate properties can be controlled by tuning core chemistry and peptide composition, but the sequence{\textendash}structure{\textendash}function relations remain poorly characterized. In this work, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations within an active learning protocol employing deep representational learning and Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify molecules capable of assembling pseudo-1D nanoaggregates with good stacking of the electronically active {$\pi$}-cores. We consider the DXXX-OPV3-XXXD oligopeptide family, where D is an Asp residue and OPV3 is an oligophenylenevinylene oligomer (1,4-distyrylbenzene), to identify the top performing XXX tripeptides within all 203 = 8000 possible sequences. By direct simulation of only 2.3\% of this space, we identify molecules predicted to exhibit superior assembly relative to those reported in prior work. Spectral clustering of the top candidates reveals new design rules governing assembly. This work establishes new understanding of DXXX-OPV3-XXXD assembly, identifies promising new candidates for experimental testing, and presents a computational design platform that can be generically extended to other peptide-based and peptide-like systems.},

In a prospective research study we develop a workflow that reports comprehensive cWGTS results in 9 days. Comparison of cWGTS to diagnostic panel assays demonstrates the potential of cWGTS to capture all clinically reported mutations with comparable sensitivity in a single workflow. Benchmarking identifies a minimum of 80{\texttimes} as optimal depth for clinical WGS sequencing. Integration of germline, somatic DNA and RNA-seq data enable data-driven variant prioritization and reporting, with oncogenic findings reported in 54\% more patients than standard of care.

Cross-sectional analysis indicated that the beads had a homogeneous crosslinked structure, as a result the beads were strengthened greatly (the mechanical strength increased more than ten times). Furthermore sodium alginate (a polyanion) can interact with cationic chitosan on the surface of these TPP/chitosan beads to form polyelectrolyte complex film for the improvement of the drug sustained release performances. The loading efficiency of model drugs (brilliant blue and FITC-dextran) in these beads was very high (more than 90\%). Crosslinking time, TPP solution pH and other preparation factors had an effect on the drug release performance of beads. The release period of brilliant blue (a poor water soluble dye) was more than 2-months at a fairly constant rate in 0.9\% NaCl, 10 mM PBS pH 7.4. However, for FITC-dextran (a water soluble polysaccharide) only 1{\textendash}2 days in the same conditions. It seems that TPP/chitosan bead prepared by the novel method is a promising formulation for drug delivery.},

Here, we develop a theory based on the Rouse model for the dynamic structure factor of a single polyampholyte chain in the weak coupling regime (negligible intramolecular electrostatics) or subjected to weak external electric fields (governed by linear response). Neglecting effects of small ions, we find deviations in scaling from the classic Rouse theory and make predictions for scattering experiments performed on polyampholytes. We find that, under weak coupling with arbitrarily strong fields, the dynamics are highly dependent on the charge distribution and consequently look at two representative examples{\textemdash}random charge densities and periodic charge densities{\textemdash}with different scaling properties. Under weak fields, the dynamics are largely independent of charge distribution. Finally, we investigate the influence of hydrodynamic effects and the implications of including inertial effects in the model.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

In light of this, we propose a novel actor-critic architecture for 3D molecular design that can generate molecular structures unattainable with previous approaches. This is achieved by exploiting the symmetries of the design process through a rotationally covariant state-action representation based on a spherical harmonics series expansion. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on several 3D molecular design tasks, where we find that building in such symmetries significantly improves generalization and the quality of generated molecules.},

Even though the basic algorithm is quite simple, it is implemented in many different ways. Apart from some minor computational details, the main difference between various implementations lies in the selection of convergence (or termination) tests, which are used to break the iteration process. A fairly simple efficiency analysis of each iteration step reveals a potential computational bottleneck in the domain convergence test. To be efficient, such a test has to be sublinear in the number of vertices of the working simplex. We have tested some of the most common implementations of the Nelder{\textendash}Mead algorithm, and none of them is efficient in this sense. Therefore, we propose a simple and efficient domain convergence test and discuss some of its properties. This test is based on tracking the volume of the working simplex throughout the iterations. Similar termination tests can also be applied in some other simplex{\textendash}based direct search methods. ({\textcopyright} 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  abstract = {Phase separation can be driven by the association of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in solution, a process known as complex coacervation. This can manifest as macrophase separation, which arises when both polymer species are homopolyelectrolytes, or can lead to microphase separation when one or both of the charged species are block copolyelectrolytes. This is not a strict dichotomy; recently, macrophase separation was observed for a number of copolymers containing sequence-defined patterns of neutral vs charged monomers, including patterns with lengthy blocks. The specific pattern can affect the strength of this macrophase separation, yet at some block length, microphase separation is expected to emerge. In this article, we describe how to incorporate a theory of sequence-defined coacervation into self-consistent field theory, allowing the study of sequence-defined polyelectrolytes in inhomogeneous systems. We show that blocky sequences can affect electrostatically driven macrophase separation and can transition to microphase separation as the blockiness of sequences increases. This micro- to macrophase separation transition is a function of both the blockiness of the sequence, the number of blocks, and the concentration of salt.},

We exploit the modularity of a refactored Klebsiella oxytoca nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster (16 genes, 103 parts) to build genetic permutations that could not be achieved by starting from the wild-type cluster. Constraint-based combinatorial design and DNA assembly are used to build libraries of radically different cluster architectures by varying part choice, gene order, gene orientation and operon occupancy. We construct 84 variants of the nifUSVWZM operon, 145 variants of the nifHDKY operon, 155 variants of the nifHDKYENJ operon and 122 variants of the complete 16-gene pathway. The performance and behavior of these variants are characterized by nitrogenase assay and strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and the results are incorporated into subsequent design cycles. We have produced a fully synthetic cluster that recovers 57\% of wild-type activity. Our approach allows the performance of genetic parts to be quantified simultaneously in hundreds of genetic contexts. This parallelized design-build-test-learn cycle, which can access previously unattainable regions of genetic space, should provide a useful, fast tool for genetic optimization and hypothesis testing.},

  abstract = {Transfer RNAs (tRNA) are the most common RNA molecules in cells and have critical roles as both translators of the genetic code and regulators of protein synthesis. As such, numerous methods have focused on studying tRNA abundance and regulation, with the most widely used methods being RNA-seq and microarrays. Though revolutionary to transcriptomics, these assays are limited by an inability to encode tRNA modifications in the requisite cDNA. These modifications are abundant in tRNA and critical to their function. Here, we describe proof-of-concept experiments where individual tRNA molecules are examined as linear strands using a biological nanopore. This method utilizes an enzymatically ligated synthetic DNA adapter to concentrate tRNA at the lipid bilayer of the nanopore device and efficiently denature individual tRNA molecules, as they are pulled through the {$\alpha$}-hemolysin ({$\alpha$}-HL) nanopore. Additionally, the DNA adapter provides a loading site for {$\phi$}29 DNA polymerase ({$\phi$}29 DNAP), which acts as a brake on the translocating tRNA. This increases the dwell time of adapted tRNA in the nanopore, allowing us to identify the region of the nanopore signal that is produced by the translocating tRNA itself. Using adapter-modified Escherichia coli tRNAfMet and tRNALys, we show that the nanopore signal during controlled translocation is dependent on the identity of the tRNA. This confirms that adapter-modified tRNA can translocate end-to-end through nanopores and provide the foundation for future work in direct sequencing of individual transfer RNA with a nanopore-based device.},

However, the lack of molecular barcoding of direct RNA nanopore sequencing data sets severely affects the applicability of this technology to biological samples, where RNA availability is often limited. Here, we provide the first experimental protocol and associated algorithm to barcode and demultiplex direct RNA nanopore sequencing data sets. Specifically, we present a novel and robust approach to accurately classify raw nanopore signal data by transforming current intensities into images or arrays of pixels, followed by classification using a deep learning algorithm. We demonstrate the power of this strategy by developing the first experimental protocol for barcoding and demultiplexing direct RNA sequencing libraries. Our method, DeePlexiCon, can classify 93\% of reads with 95.1\% accuracy or 60\% of reads with 99.9\% accuracy. The availability of an efficient and simple multiplexing strategy for native RNA sequencing will improve the cost-effectiveness of this technology, as well as facilitate the analysis of lower-input biological samples. Overall, our work exemplifies the power, simplicity, and robustness of signal-to-image conversion for nanopore data analysis using deep learning.},

Further, we extend the model, which was previously parameterised to just one salt concentration ([Na+] = 0.5M), so that it can be used for a range of salt concentrations including those corresponding to physiological conditions. Finally, we use new experimental data to parameterise the oxDNA potential so that consecutive adenine bases stack with a different strength to consecutive thymine bases, a feature which allows a more accurate treatment of systems where the flexibility of single-stranded regions is important. We illustrate the new possibilities opened up by the updated model, oxDNA2, by presenting results from simulations of the structure of large DNA objects and by using the model to investigate some salt-dependent properties of DNA.},

Compared to the in-plant total trihalomethanes (TTHM) levels, TTHM levels in the distribution system increased from less than 150\% to more than 300\%. Significant variations for TTHM and bromate (BrO3-) levels throughout the seasons were also observed; generally higher levels in the summer and lower levels in the winter. Combining chemical DBP models (empirical power functional models) and hydraulic simulations, DBPs including TTHM and BrO3- were successfully simulated from the full-scale monitoring data, indicating that empirical DBP model can be a potential tool to access DBP formation in actual plants.

  abstract = {The ability to routinely identify and quantify the complete proteome from single cells will greatly advance medicine and basic biology research. To meet this challenge of single-cell proteomics, single-molecule technologies are being developed and improved. Most approaches, to date, rely on the analysis of polypeptides, resulting from digested proteins, either in solution or immobilized on a surface. Nanopore biosensing is an emerging single-molecule technique that circumvents surface immobilization and is optimally suited for the analysis of long biopolymers, as has already been shown for DNA sequencing. However, proteins, unlike DNA molecules, are not uniformly charged and harbor complex tertiary structures. Consequently, the ability of nanopores to analyze unfolded full-length proteins has remained elusive. Here, we evaluate the use of heat denaturation and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to facilitate electrokinetic nanopore sensing of unfolded proteins. Specifically, we characterize the voltage dependence translocation dynamics of a wide molecular weight range of proteins (from 14 to 130 kDa) through sub-5 nm solid-state nanopores, using a SDS concentration below the critical micelle concentration. Our results suggest that proteins' translocation dynamics are significantly slower than expected, presumably due to the smaller nanopore diameters used in our study and the role of the electroosmotic force opposing the translocation direction. This allows us to distinguish among the proteins of different molecular weights based on their dwell time and electrical charge deficit. Given the simplicity of the protein denaturation assay and circumvention of the tailor-made necessities for sensing protein of different folded sizes, shapes, and charges, this approach can facilitate the development of a whole proteome identification technique.},

  abstract = {Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention.Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.},

  abstract = {We provide a critical assessment of explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of RNA and protein/RNA complexes, written primarily for non-specialists with an emphasis to explain the limitations of MD. MD simulations can be likened to hypothetical single-molecule experiments starting from single atomistic conformations and investigating genuine thermal sampling of the biomolecules. The main advantage of MD is the unlimited temporal and spatial resolution of positions of all atoms in the simulated systems. Fundamental limitations are the short physical time-scale of simulations, which can be partially alleviated by enhanced-sampling techniques, and the highly approximate atomistic force fields describing the simulated molecules. The applicability and present limitations of MD are demonstrated on studies of tetranucleotides, tetraloops, ribozymes, riboswitches and protein/RNA complexes. Wisely applied simulations respecting the approximations of the model can successfully complement structural and biochemical experiments. WIREs RNA 2017, 8:e1405. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1405.

  abstract = {With both catalytic and genetic functions, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is perhaps the most pluripotent chemical species in molecular biology, and its functions are intimately linked to its structure and dynamics. Computer simulations, and in particular atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), allow structural dynamics of biomolecular systems to be investigated with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We here provide a comprehensive overview of the fast-developing field of MD simulations of RNA molecules. We begin with an in-depth, evaluatory coverage of the most fundamental methodological challenges that set the basis for the future development of the field, in particular, the current developments and inherent physical limitations of the atomistic force fields and the recent advances in a broad spectrum of enhanced sampling methods. We also survey the closely related field of coarse-grained modeling of RNA systems. After dealing with the methodological aspects, we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides to investigations of the entire ribosome. Our review encompasses tetranucleotides, tetraloops, a number of small RNA motifs, A-helix RNA, kissing-loop complexes, the TAR RNA element, the decoding center and other important regions of the ribosome, as well as assorted others systems. Extended sections are devoted to RNA-ion interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches, and protein/RNA complexes. Our overview is written for as broad of an audience as possible, aiming to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary bridge between computation and experiment, together with a perspective on the future of the field.},

  abstract = {When oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are mixed below a critical salt concentration, their mixtures show macroscopic phase separation into a dilute and a dense, polyelectrolyte complex phase. Binodal compositions of the polyelectrolyte complexes have been measured experimentally using fluorescently labeled polyelectrolytes. We used fluorescein-labeled poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) of four different chain lengths (N = 20, 50, 150, and 510) to determine the binodal compositions of polyelectrolyte complexes of PAA and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) of similar chain lengths. The water content of polyelectrolyte complexes obtained has a lower limit of about 65\%, practically independent of chain length, and increases with increasing salt concentration. We interpret our results on binodal compositions, water content and critical salt concentration as a function of chain length using the mean-field model of Voorn and Overbeek and find good quantitative agreement with our experiments using only one adjustable parameter. We believe that such a model can be used to predict equilibrium concentrations also for other strongly charged flexible polyelectrolytes.},

  abstract = {We investigate the microscopic structure and density fluctuations of complex coacervates of flexible polyelectrolytes using scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and light. Poly(acrylic acid) and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) offer a well-defined model system that allows for selective labeling and systematic variation of the strength of the attractive electrostatic interactions. Two neutron scattering experiments have been carried out: (i) we use deuterated polymeric tracers in a complex coacervate with an overall neutron scattering length density that is matched to that of the solvent, to probe the conformation of single polymer chains in the complex coacervates, and (ii) we measure complex coacervates in which all polymer chains of one type are deuterated, to probe their overall structure. The single chain static structure factors reveal that both polycations and polyanions have an ideal Gaussian chain conformation in the complex coacervates. At the same time, the overall structure is similar to that of a semidilute polymer solution, with polycations and polyanions strongly overlapping to form a network with a mesh size that is much smaller than the radius of gyration of the polymers. The mesh size decreases with decreasing salt concentration, following a scaling that is in good agreement with predictions from the corresponding salt{\textendash}polymer phase diagram. These findings are confirmed by complementary X-ray scattering experiments. Finally, in all scattering experiments with light, X-rays, and neutrons, and for all polymer chain lengths and salt concentrations, we find a remarkable low-q excess scattering, following a power law with a slope close to -2. This points to the presence of equilibrium, large-scale density fluctuations in the complex coacervates. Dynamic light scattering experiments reveal two complementary diffusive modes in the complex coacervates, corresponding to fluctuations of the polymer mesh and diffusion of domains of varying density, respectively.},

  abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ``thinned'' networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining},

  abstract = {Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit "breakthrough" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.},

  abstract = {A series of amphiphilic ionic peptoid block copolymers where the total number (1 or 3) and position of ionic monomers along the polymer chain are precisely controlled have been synthesized by the submonomer method. Upon dissolution in water at pH = 9, the amphiphilic peptoids self-assemble into small spherical micelles having hydrodynamic radius in {$\sim$}5{\textendash}10 nm range and critical micellar concentration (CMC) in the 0.034{\textendash}0.094 mg/mL range. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis of the micellar solutions revealed unprecedented dependence of the micellar structure on the number and position of ionic monomers along the chain. It was found that the micellar aggregation number (Nagg) and the micellar radius (Rm) both increase as the ionic monomer is positioned progressively away from the junction of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments along the polymer chain. By defining an ionic monomer position number (n) as the number of monomers between the junction and the ionic monomer, Nagg exhibited a power law dependence on n with an exponent of {$\sim$}1/3 and {$\sim$}3/10 for the respective singly and triply charged series. By contrast, Rm exhibited a weaker dependence on the ionic monomer position by a power law relationship with an exponent of {$\sim$}1/10 and {$\sim$}1/20 for the respective singly and triply charged series. Furthermore, Rm was found to scale with Nagg in a power-law relationship with an exponent of 0.32 for the singly charged series, consistent with a weakly charged ionic star-like polymer model in the unscreened regime. This study demonstrated a unique method to precisely tailor the structure of small spherical micelles based on ionic block copolymers by controlling the sequence and position of the ionic monomer.},

Morphological studies of the secretory system suggested that the natural process does not involve complex coacervation as commonly defined. The distinction may not be important because electrostatic interactions likely play an important role in the formation of the sandcastle glue. Complex coacervation has also been invoked in the formation of adhesive underwater silk fibers of caddisfly larvae and the adhesive plaques of mussels. A process similar to complex coacervation, that is, condensation and dehydration of biopolyelectrolytes through electrostatic associations, seems plausible for the caddisfly silk. This much is clear, the sandcastle glue complex coacervation model provided a valuable blueprint for the synthesis of a biomimetic, water-borne, underwater adhesive with demonstrated potential for repair of wet tissue.},

  abstract = {Sandcastle worms, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes), live along the western coast of North America. Individual worms build tubular shells under seawater by gluing together sandgrains and biomineral particles with a multipart, rapid-set, self-initiating adhesive. The glue comprises distinct sets of condensed, oppositely charged polyelectrolytic components{\textemdash}polyphosphates, polysulfates, and polyamines{\textemdash}that are separately granulated and stored at high concentration in distinct cell types. The pre-organized adhesive modules are secreted separately and intact, but rapidly fuse with minimal mixing and expand into a crack-penetrating complex fluid. Within 30s of secretion into seawater, the fluid adhesive transitions (sets) into a porous solid adhesive joint. The nano- and microporous structure of the foamy solid adhesive contributes to the strength and toughness of the adhesive joint through several mechanisms. A curing agent (catechol oxidase), co-packaged into both types of adhesive granules, covalently cross-links the adhesive and becomes a structural component of the final adhesive joint. The overall effectiveness of the granulated sandcastle glue is more a product of the cellular sorting and packaging mechanisms, the transition from fluid to solid following secretion, and its final biphasic porous structure as it is of its composition or any particular amino acid modification.},

Development of new sensitive analytical point-of-care tests are, therefore, necessary for direct biomarker detection from biofluids as critical tools to address the healthcare needs of an aging global population. Coagulation disorders associated with stroke, heart attack, or cancer are defined by an increased level of the fibrinopeptide A (FPA) biomarker, among others. This biomarker exists in more than one form: it can be post-translationally modified with a phosphate and also cleaved to form shorter peptides. Current assays are long and have difficulties in discriminating between these derivatives; hence, this is an underutilized biomarker for routine clinical practice. We use nanopore sensing to identify FPA, the phosphorylated FPA, and two derivatives. Each of these peptides is characterized by unique electrical signals for both dwell time and blockade level. We also show that the phosphorylated form of FPA can adopt two different conformations, each of which have different values for each electrical parameter. We were able to use these parameters to discriminate these peptides from a mix, thereby opening the way for the potential development of new point-of-care tests.},

We propose the basecRAWller algorithm, a pair of unidirectional recurrent neural networks that enables the calling of DNA bases in real time directly from the rawest form of nanopore output. This shift in nanopore basecalling provides a number of advantages over current processing pipelines including: 1) streaming basecalling, 2) tunable ratio of insertions to deletions, and 3) potential for streaming detection of modified bases. Key to the streaming basecalling capability is sequence prediction at a delay of less than 1/100th of a second, allowing future signal to continuously modulate sequence prediction. BasecRAWller is computationally efficient enabling basecalling at speeds faster than current nanopore instrument measurement speeds on a single core. Further, basecalling can be paused and resumed without any change in the resulting predicted sequence, transforming the potential applications for dynamic read rejection capabilities. The basecRAWller algorithm provides an alternative approach to nanopore basecalling at comparable accuracy and provides the community with the capacity to train their own basecRAWller neural networks with minimal effort.},

The method is illustrated by parameterizing two new charge models called AM1-CM1A and PM3-CM1P, based on experimental dipole moments and, respectively, on AM1 and PM3 semiempirical electronic wave functions. These charge models yield rms errors of 0.30 and 0.26 D, respectively, in the dipole moments of a set of 195 neutral molecules consisting of 103 molecules containing H, C, N and O, covering variations of multiple common organic functional groups, 68 fluorides, chlorides, bromides and iodides, 15 compounds containing H, C, Si or S, and 9 compounds containing C-S-O or C-N-O linkages. In addition, partial charges computed with this method agree extremely well with high-level ab initio calculations for both neutral compounds and ions. The CM1 charge models provide a more accurate point charge representation of the dipole moment than provided by most previously available partial charges, and they are far less expensive to compute. {\textcopyright} 1995 ESCOM Science Publishers B.V.},

This nonlinear scaling is strikingly different from the well-studied linear behavior observed in similar experiments performed on protein pores.

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.},

  abstract = {There is a perceived dichotomy between structure-based and descriptor-based molecular representations used for predictive chemistry tasks. Here, we study the performance, generalizability, and interpretability of the recently proposed quantum mechanics-augmented graph neural network (ml-QM-GNN) architecture as applied to the prediction of regioselectivity (classification) and of activation energies (regression). In our hybrid QM-augmented model architecture, structure-based representations are first used to predict a set of atom- and bond-level reactivity descriptors derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These estimated reactivity descriptors are combined with the original structure-based representation to make the final reactivity prediction. We demonstrate that our model architecture leads to significant improvements over structure-based GNNs in not only overall accuracy, but also in generalization to unseen compounds. Even when provided training sets of only a couple hundred labeled data points, the ml-QM-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art model architectures that have been applied to these tasks. Further, because the predictions of our model are grounded in (but not restricted to) QM descriptors, we are able to relate predictions to the conceptual frameworks commonly used to gain qualitative insights into reactivity phenomena. This effort results in a productive synergy between theory and data science, wherein our QM-augmented models provide a data-driven confirmation of previous qualitative analyses, and these analyses in their turn facilitate insights into the decision-making process occurring within ml-QM-GNNs.},

In order to explore its strengths and weaknesses, we test the model in a range of nanotechnological and biological settings. Applications explored include the folding thermodynamics of a pseudoknot, the formation of a kissing loop complex, the structure of a hexagonal RNA nanoring, and the unzipping of a hairpin motif.

  abstract = {Ropes or yarns, especially when disorderly packed, are prone to develop knots. Polymers are no exception to this rule and, in fact, rigorous mathematical results have been proved regarding the "statistical necessity" that sufficiently-long circular chains are knotted. The current surge of scientific interest in knotted polymers, and especially biopolymers, is prompted by the need to understand the profound im- plications that these forms of entanglement can have on the mechanical, dynamical and conformational properties of polymer chains. For proteins, for instance, a long standing problem is how exactly the knotting properties of naturally-occurring proteins differ from those of general, non-specific, polymer models. This question has, in fact, motivated studies in several directions, from surveying and classifying systematically the repertoire of knots in peptide chains, to establishing the details of the folding route. For genomic DNA instead, it has long been known that it can be highly entangled due to the high packing de- gree that it attains in all organisms, from viruses to eukaryotic cells. In this case, the advent of single-molecule manipulation techniques, which are routinely applied to DNA filaments of various length, has opened new, and still largely unexplored, per- spectives for detecting or controlling the spontaneous knotting properties of DNA.},

We employed deep neural networks (NNs) as an efficient and intelligent surrogate of molecular simulations for complex sorption equilibria using probabilistic modeling. Canonical ( N 1 N 2 VT ) Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations were performed to model a single-stage equilibrium desorptive drying process for (1,4-butanediol or 1,5-pentanediol)/water and 1,5-pentanediol/ethanol from all-silica MFI zeolite and 1,5-pentanediol/water from all-silica LTA zeolite. A multi-task deep NN was trained on the simulation data to predict equilibrium loadings as a function of thermodynamic state variables. The NN accurately reproduces simulation results and is able to obtain a continuous isotherm function. Its predictions can be therefore utilized to facilitate optimization of desorption conditions, which requires a laborious iterative search if undertaken by simulation alone. Furthermore, it learns information about the binary sorption equilibria as hidden layer representations. This allows for application of transfer learning with limited data by fine-tuning a pretrained NN for a different alkanediol/solvent/zeolite system.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10 {\texttimes} or 100 {\texttimes} ? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between 'enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

PLGA-based biodegradable microspheres have been studied in the field of drug delivery, including the delivery of various anticancer drugs, protein or peptide drugs, bacterial or viral DNA, etc. This review describes the basic knowledge and current situation of PLGA biodegradable microspheres and discusses the selection of PLGA polymer materials. Then, the preparation methods of PLGA microspheres are introduced, including emulsification, microfluidic technology, electrospray, and spray drying. Finally, this review summarizes the application of PLGA microspheres in drug delivery and the treatment of pulmonary and ocular-related diseases.},

  abstract = {Cell survival is conditional on the maintenance of a favourable acid{\textendash}base balance (pH). Owing to intensive respiratory CO2 and lactic acid production, cancer cells are exposed continuously to large acid{\textendash}base fluxes, which would disturb pH if uncorrected. The large cellular reservoir of H+-binding sites can buffer pH changes but, on its own, is inadequate to regulate intracellular pH. To stabilize intracellular pH at a favourable level, cells control trans-membrane traffic of H+-ions (or their chemical equivalents, e.g. ) using specialized transporter proteins sensitive to pH. In poorly perfused tumours, additional diffusion-reaction mechanisms, involving carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes, fine-tune control extracellular pH. The ability of H+-ions to change the ionization state of proteins underlies the exquisite pH sensitivity of cellular behaviour, including key processes in cancer formation and metastasis (proliferation, cell cycle, transformation, migration). Elevated metabolism, weakened cell-to-capillary diffusive coupling, and adaptations involving H+/H+-equivalent transporters and extracellular-facing CAs give cancer cells the means to manipulate micro-environmental acidity, a cancer hallmark. Through genetic instability, the cellular apparatus for regulating and sensing pH is able to adapt to extracellular acidity, driving disease progression. The therapeutic potential of disturbing this sequence by targeting H+/H+-equivalent transporters, buffering or CAs is being investigated, using monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors.},

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2\% top-1 and 5:6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3:5\% top-5 error and 17:3\% top-1 error on the validation set and 3:6\% top-5 error on the official test set.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4\% top-1 / 97.1\% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the most-widely used technology to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2. However, RT-PCR requires the extraction of viral RNA from clinical specimens to obtain high sensitivity. Here, we report a method for detecting novel coronaviruses with high sensitivity by using nanopores together with artificial intelligence, a relatively simple procedure that does not require RNA extraction. Our final platform, which we call the artificially intelligent nanopore, consists of machine learning software on a server, a portable high-speed and high-precision current measuring instrument, and scalable, cost-effective semiconducting nanopore modules. We show that artificially intelligent nanopores are successful in accurately identifying four types of coronaviruses similar in size, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimen is achieved with a sensitivity of 90\% and specificity of 96\% with a 5-minute measurement.},

We thus propose the LXMERT (Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework to learn these vision-and-language connections. In LXMERT, we build a large-scale Transformer model that consists of three encoders: an object relationship encoder, a language encoder, and a cross-modality encoder. Next, to endow our model with the capability of connecting vision and language semantics, we pre-train the model with large amounts of image-and-sentence pairs, via five diverse representative pre-training tasks: masked language modeling, masked object prediction (feature regression and label classification), cross-modality matching, and image question answering. These tasks help in learning both intra-modality and cross-modality relationships. After fine-tuning from our pre-trained parameters, our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on two visual question answering datasets (i.e., VQA and GQA). We also show the generalizability of our pre-trained cross-modality model by adapting it to a challenging visual-reasoning task, NLVR2, and improve the previous best result by 22\% absolute (54\% to 76\%). Lastly, we demonstrate detailed ablation studies to prove that both our novel model components and pretraining strategies significantly contribute to our strong results.1.},

For ions (especially multivalent ions) in the close vicinity of nucleic acid surface, interion correlations and ion-binding mode fluctuations may be important. Poisson-Boltzmann theory ignores these effects whereas the recently developed tightly bound ion (TBI) theory explicitly accounts for these effects. Extensive experimental data demonstrate that the TBI theory gives improved predictions for multivalent ions (e.g., Mg2+) than the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. In this study, we use the TBI theory to investigate how the metal ions affect the folding stability of B-DNA helices. We quantitatively evaluate the effects of ion concentration, ion size and valence, and helix length on the helix stability. Moreover, we derive practically useful analytical formulas for the thermodynamic parameters as functions of finite helix length, ion type, and ion concentration. We find that the helix stability is additive for high ion concentration and long helix and nonadditive for low ion concentration and short helix. All these results are tested against and supported by extensive experimental data.},

However, machine learning (ML) models can incorporate both chemical composition and sequence distribution of monomers, and have the generalization ability to process various copolymer types (e.g., alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers) with a unified approach are missing. To address this challenge, we formulate four different ML models for investigation, including a feedforward neural network (FFNN) model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, and a combined FFNN/RNN (Fusion) model. We use various copolymer types to systematically validate the performance and generalizability of different models. We find that the RNN architecture that processes the monomer sequence information both forward and backward is a more suitable ML model for copolymers with better generalizability. As a supplement to polymer informatics, our proposed approach provides an efficient way for the evaluation of copolymers.},

This paper investigates the true importance and contribution of the dot product-based self-attention mechanism on the performance of Transformer models. Via extensive experiments, we find that (1) random alignment matrices surprisingly perform quite competitively and (2) learning attention weights from token-token (query-key) interactions is useful but not that important after all. To this end, we propose {\textbackslash}textsc\{Synthesizer\}, a model that learns synthetic attention weights without token-token interactions. In our experiments, we first show that simple Synthesizers achieve highly competitive performance when compared against vanilla Transformer models across a range of tasks, including machine translation, language modeling, text generation and GLUE/SuperGLUE benchmarks. When composed with dot product attention, we find that Synthesizers consistently outperform Transformers. Moreover, we conduct additional comparisons of Synthesizers against Dynamic Convolutions, showing that simple Random Synthesizer is not only \$60{\textbackslash}\%\$ faster but also improves perplexity by a relative \$3.5{\textbackslash}\%\$. Finally, we show that simple factorized Synthesizers can outperform Linformers on encoding only tasks.},

  abstract = {Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning. Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide "obviously" interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that (1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution, (2) insights into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices, and (3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically- and technically-grounded medical education are encouraged.},

In this work, with an adequate training scheme, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train it on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1\% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. We share our code and models to accelerate community advances on this line of research. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 84.4\% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks.},

Here, we applied comparative evolutionary analyses to estimate the durability of immunity and the likelihood of breakthrough infections over time following vaccination by BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson \& Johnson/Janssen). We evaluated anti-Spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels elicited by each vaccine relative to natural infection. We estimated typical trajectories of waning and corresponding infection probabilities, providing the distribution of times to breakthrough infection for each vaccine under endemic conditions. Peak antibody levels elicited by messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines mRNA-1273 and BNT1262b2 exceeded that of natural infection and are expected to typically yield more durable protection against breakthrough infections (median 29.6 mo; 5 to 95\% quantiles 10.9 mo to 7.9 y) than natural infection (median 21.5 mo; 5 to 95\% quantiles 3.5 mo to 7.1 y). Relative to mRNA-1273 and BNT1262b2, viral vector vaccines ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S exhibit similar peak anti-S IgG antibody responses to that from natural infection and are projected to yield lower, shorter-term protection against breakthrough infection (median 22.4 mo and 5 to 95\% quantiles 4.3 mo to 7.2 y; and median 20.5 mo and 5 to 95\% quantiles 2.6 mo to 7.0 y; respectively).

  abstract = {The discovery and development of catalysts and catalytic processes are essential components to maintaining an ecological balance in the future. Recent revolutions made in data science could have a great impact on traditional catalysis research in both industry and academia and could accelerate the development of catalysts. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of data science, can play a central role in this paradigm shift away from the use of traditional approaches. In this review, we present a user's guide for ML that we believe will be helpful for scientists performing research in the field of catalysis and summarize recent progress that has been made in utilizing ML to create homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The focus of the review is on the design, synthesis, and characterization of catalytic materials/compounds as well as their applications to catalyzed processes. The ML technique not only enhances ways to discover catalysts but also serves as a powerful tool to establish a deeper understanding of relationships between the properties of materials/compounds and their catalytic activities, selectivities, and stabilities. This knowledge facilitates the establishment of principles employed to design catalysts and to enhance their efficiencies. Despite such advantages of ML, it is noteworthly that the current ML-assisted development of real catalysts remains in its infancy, mainly because of the complexity of catalysis associated with the fact that catalysis is a time-dependent dynamic event. In this review, we discuss how seamless integration of experiment, theory, and data science can be used to accelerate catalyst development and to guide future studies aimed at applications that will impact society's need to produce energy, materials, and chemicals. Moreover, the limitations and difficulties of ML in catalysis research originating from the complex nature of catalysis are discussed in order to make the catalysis community aware of challenges that need to be addressed for effective and practical use of ML in the field.},

We have directly computed the polymer size, form factor, free energy, and Kirkwood diffusivity for unconfined wormlike chains as a function of molecular weight, focusing on persistence lengths and effective widths that represent single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in a high ionic strength buffer. To do so, we use a chain-growth Monte Carlo algorithm, the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), which allows us to estimate equilibrium and near-equilibrium dynamic properties of wormlike chains over an extremely large range of contour lengths. From our calculations, we find that very large DNA chains ({$\approx$}1 000 000, base pairs depending on the choice of size metric) are required to reach flexible, swollen nondraining coils. Furthermore, our results indicate that the commonly used model polymer {$\lambda$}-DNA (48 500, base pairs) does not exhibit ``ideal'' scaling but exists in the middle of the transition to long-chain behavior. We subsequently conclude that typical DNA used in experiments are too short to serve as an accurate model of long-chain, universal polymer behavior.},

Such effects can be studied using polypeptoids, which permit the synthesis of polymer chains with precise monomer sequences. Here, we use single-molecule force experiments to explore the effect of charge spacing on polypeptoid conformation. We tested polypeptoid sequences composed of monomers that are either hydrophilic and uncharged or negatively charged. We find that the chain persistence length is insensitive to the net charge and ionic strength. With increasing solution ionic strength, we observe a good-to-theta transition in solvent quality with a theta point that scales with the charge spacing. Our results thus reveal a complex interplay between electrostatically driven excluded volume effects and charge-insensitive local conformational flexibility, which we posit is related to the location of charged groups on the side chains.},

Here, machine learning tools are applied to analyze the solvent annealing process and predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity. Two neural networks are constructed and trained, yielding accurate prediction of the final morphology in agreement with experimental data.

Results of this analysis showed that these proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected for members of a single thermodynamic entity. Rather, these proteins may be divided into two structurally different groups: intrinsic coils, and premolten globules. Proteins from the first group have hydrodynamic dimensions typical of random coils in poor solvent and do not possess any (or almost any) ordered secondary structure. Proteins from the second group are essentially more compact, exhibiting some amount of residual secondary structure, although they are still less dense than native or molten globule proteins. An important feature of the intrinsically unstructured proteins is that they undergo disorder{\textendash}order transition during or prior to their biological function. In this respect, the Protein Quartet model, with function arising from four specific conformations (ordered forms, molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils) and transitions between any two of the states, is discussed.},

A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

The electron cryo-microscopy structure of CsgG in complex with full-length CsgF shows that the 33 N-terminal residues of CsgF bind inside the {$\beta$}-barrel of the pore, forming a defined second constriction.

Here, we propose a neural-network approach to finding phase transitions, based on the performance of a neural network after it is trained with data that are deliberately labelled incorrectly. We demonstrate the success of this method on the topological phase transition in the Kitaev chain, the thermal phase transition in the classical Ising model, and the many-body-localization transition in a disordered quantum spin chain. Our method does not depend on order parameters, knowledge of the topological content of the phases, or any other specifics of the transition at hand. It therefore paves the way to the development of a generic tool for identifying unexplored phase transitions.},

  abstract = {While scientists can often infer the biological function of proteins from their 3-dimensional quaternary structures, the gap between the number of known protein sequences and their experimentally determined structures keeps increasing. A potential solution to this problem is presented by ever more sophisticated computational protein modelling approaches. While often powerful on their own, most methods have strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it benefits researchers to examine models from various model providers and perform comparative analysis to identify what models can best address their specific use cases. To make data from a large array of model providers more easily accessible to the broader scientific community, we established 3D-Beacons, a collaborative initiative to create a federated network with unified data access mechanisms. The 3D-Beacons Network allows researchers to collate coordinate files and metadata for experimentally determined and theoretical protein models from state-of-the-art and specialist model providers and also from the Protein Data Bank.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1{\textendash}3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players.

We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players.

We find that the most important and confident heads play consistent and often linguistically-interpretable roles. When pruning heads using a method based on stochastic gates and a differentiable relaxation of the L0 penalty, we observe that specialized heads are last to be pruned. Our novel pruning method removes the vast majority of heads without seriously affecting performance. For example, on the English-Russian WMT dataset, pruning 38 out of 48 encoder heads results in a drop of only 0.15 BLEU.1},

  abstract = {In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying 'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature.},

Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65\% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

Here, using graphene liquid-cell electron microscopy with electrons of low energy at low dose, we show that this approach resolves the time dependence of conformational adaptations of macromolecules for times up to minutes, the resolution determined by motion blurring, with DNA as the test case. Single-stranded DNA molecules are observed in real time as they hybridize near the solid surface to form double-stranded helices; we contrast molecules the same length but differing in base-pair microstructure (random, blocky, and palindromic hairpin) whose key difference is that random sequences possess only one stable final state, but the others offer metastable intermediate structures. Hybridization is observed to couple with enhanced translational mobility and torsion-induced rotation of the molecule. Prevalent transient loops are observed in error-correction processes. Transient melting and other failed encounters are observed in the competitive binding of multiple single-stranded molecules. Among the intermediate states reported here, some were predicted but not observed previously, and the high incidence of looping and enhanced mobility come as surprises. The error-producing mechanisms, failed encounters, and transient intermediate states would not be easily resolved by traditional single-molecule methods. The methods generalize to visualize motions and interactions of other organic macromolecules.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from O(n2) to O(n) in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the Linformer, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.},

To overcome this limitation, we present a framework to improve computational efficiency by orders of magnitude. The key concept is to train a neural network using a limited number of simulations generated by a mechanistic model. This number is small enough such that the simulations can be completed in a short time frame but large enough to enable reliable training. The trained neural network can then be used to explore a much larger parametric space. We demonstrate this notion by training neural networks to predict pattern formation and stochastic gene expression. We further demonstrate that using an ensemble of neural networks enables the self-contained evaluation of the quality of each prediction. Our work can be a platform for fast parametric space screening of biological models with user defined objectives.},

  abstract = {Nanopore sequencing is regarded as one of the most promising third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. Since 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has developed a series of devices based on nanopore sequencing to produce very long reads, with an expected impact on genomics. However, the nanopore sequencing reads are susceptible to a fairly high error rate owing to the difficulty in identifying the DNA bases from the complex electrical signals. Although several basecalling tools have been developed for nanopore sequencing over the past years, it is still challenging to correct the sequences after applying the basecalling procedure. In this study, we developed an open-source DNA basecalling reviser, NanoReviser, based on a deep learning algorithm to correct the basecalling errors introduced by current basecallers provided by default. In our module, we re-segmented the raw electrical signals based on the basecalled sequences provided by the default basecallers. By employing convolution neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, we took advantage of the information from the raw electrical signals and the basecalled sequences from the basecallers. Our results showed NanoReviser, as a post-basecalling reviser, significantly improving the basecalling quality. After being trained on standard ONT sequencing reads from public E. coli and human NA12878 datasets, NanoReviser reduced the sequencing error rate by over 5\% for both the E. coli dataset and the human dataset. The performance of NanoReviser was found to be better than those of all current basecalling tools. Furthermore, we analyzed the modified bases of the E. coli dataset and added the methylation information to train our module. With the methylation annotation, NanoReviser reduced the error rate by 7\% for the E. coli dataset and specifically reduced the error rate by over 10\% for the regions of the sequence rich in methylated bases. To the best of our knowledge, NanoReviser is the first post-processing tool after basecalling to accurately correct the nanopore sequences without the time-consuming procedure of building the consensus sequence.

  abstract = {A series of poly(vinyl alcohol)-trimellitate (PVA-T) polymers with different esterification degrees (ED: 82, 61, and 32 mol\%) were prepared through the esterification of PVA and trimellitic anhydride (TA). Solubilities of these polymers and the swelling properties of PVA-T hydrogels, which were prepared by crosslinking with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDGE), were investigated in various salt solutions comprising of SO42{\`A}, Cl{\`A}, SCN{\`A} and Li{\th}, Na{\th}, K{\th}, Cs{\th}. The PVA-T polymers proved to have larger solubilities in salt solutions (1 M) than in pure water, and the ionic ``salting-in'' effect was significant in order of SO42{\`A} {$>$} SCN{\`A} {$>$} Cl{\`A} for anions, and Li{\th} {$>$} Na{\th} {$>$} K{\th} {$>$} Cs{\th} for cations, regardless of their ED values. The PVA-T hydrogels also showed corresponding swelling properties; they significantly swelled in sulfate solutions of medium concentration (0.1{\textendash}1 M), while in other salt solutions no appreciable swelling occurred. The marked salting-in effects exerted by sulfate anion, which is otherwise a typical ``saltingout'' agent, means that PVA-T polymers have an ``anti-Hofmeister Series'' (anti-HS) property. This is naturally ascribed to the trimellitic acid group because the degree of swelling in sulfate solutions was more significant for PVA-T with higher ED values; the combination of p-electron system and acidic protons seems to be essential to endow polymers with the anti-HS property.},

These growing complexities have provided industrial players and their customers access to new markets through product differentiation, improved performance, and compatibility/stability with other products. One strategy for enabling more complex formulations is the use of active encapsulation. When encapsulation is employed, strategies are required to effect the release of the active at the desired location and time of action. One particular route that has received significant academic research effort is the employment of triggers to induce active release upon a specific stimulus, though little has translated for industrial use to date. To address emerging industrial formulation needs, in this review, we discuss areas of trigger release chemistries and their applications specifically as relevant to industrial use. We focus the discussion on the use of heat, light, shear, and pH triggers as applied in several model polymeric systems for inducing active release. The goal is that through this review trends will emerge for how technologies can be better developed to maximize their value through industrial adaptation.},

A well-defined polymer of sulfobetaine was synthesized and fluorescently labeled. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was adopted to probe diffusion and chain size of polyzwitterion single chains in extremely dilute aqueous solutions over a broad concentration range of added salts. By the introduction of inorganic salts and organic inner salts, the single chains of polyzwitterions expanded with an increase of salt concentration. This observation indicates that the break-up of the dipole{\textendash}dipole attraction between the zwitterion units is the mechanism of the anti-polyelectrolyte effect of polyzwitterions. The difference in the strength of the anti-polyelectrolyte effect induced by inorganic salts and organic inner salts also indicates the partial contribution from the asymmetric adsorption of ions onto polyzwitterion chains. {\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Chemical Industry},

Delivering such a model presents numerous challenges: It should improve the performance when the input signal consists of overlapped speech, and must not hurt the speech recognition performance under all other acoustic conditions. Besides, this model must be tiny, fast, and perform inference in a streaming fashion, in order to have minimal impact on CPU, memory, battery and latency. We propose novel techniques to meet these multi-faceted requirements, including using a new asymmetric loss, and adopting adaptive runtime suppression strength. We also show that such a model can be quantized as a 8-bit integer model and run in realtime.},

Despite the benefits of MinION to sequence ultra-long reads in real-time, the high error rate of the existing base-calling methods, especially indels (insertions and deletions), prevents its use in a variety of applications. Methods: In this paper, we show that such indel errors are largely due to the segmentation process on the input electrical current signal from MinION. All existing methods conduct segmentation and nucleotide label prediction in a sequential manner, in which the errors accumulated in the first step will irreversibly influence the final base-calling. We further show that the indel issue can be significantly reduced via accurate labeling of nucleotide and move labels directly from the raw signal, which can then be efficiently learned by a bi-directionalWaveNet model simultaneously through feature sharing. Our bi-directional WaveNet model with residual blocks and skip connections is able to capture the extremely long dependency in the raw signal. Taking the predicted move as the segmentation guidance, we employ the Viterbi decoding to obtain the final base-calling results from the smoothed nucleotide probability matrix. Results: Our proposed base-caller, WaveNano, achieves good performance on real MinION sequencing data from Lambda phage. Conclusions: The signal-level nanopore base-callerWaveNano can obtain higher base-calling accuracy, and generate fewer insertions/deletions in the base-called sequences.

However, analyzing the raw nanopore signal data provides many more opportunities beyond just sequencing genomes and transcriptomes: algorithms that use machine learning approaches to extract biological information from these signals allow the detection of DNA and RNA modifications, the estimation of poly(A) tail length, and the prediction of RNA secondary structures. In this review, we discuss how developments in machine learning methodologies contributed to more accurate basecalling and lower error rates, and how these methods enable new biological discoveries. We argue that direct nanopore sequencing of DNA and RNA provides a new dimensionality for genomics experiments and highlight challenges and future directions for computational approaches to extract the additional information provided by nanopore signal data.},

  abstract = {A novel methodology is introduced here to generate coarse-grained (CG) representations of molecular models for simulations. The proposed strategy relies on basic graph-theoretic principles and is referred to as graph-based coarse-graining (GBCG). It treats a given system as a molecular graph and derives a corresponding CG representation by using edge contractions to combine nodes in the graph, which correspond to atoms in the molecule, into CG sites. A key element of this methodology is that the nodes are combined according to well-defined protocols that rank-order nodes based on the underlying chemical connectivity. By iteratively performing these operations, successively coarser representations of the original atomic system can be produced to yield a systematic set of CG mappings with hierarchical resolution in an automated fashion. These capabilities are demonstrated in the context of several test systems, including toluene, pentadecane, a polysaccharide dimer, and a rhodopsin protein. In these examples, GBCG yields multiple, intuitive structures that naturally preserve the chemical topology of the system. Importantly, these representations are rendered from algorithmic implementation rather than an arbitrary ansatz, which, until now, has been the conventional approach for defining CG mapping schemes. Overall, the results presented here indicate that GBCG is efficient, robust, and unambiguous in its application, making it a valuable tool for future CG modeling.},

In this study, we present a multiscale atomistic-to-continuum approach for modeling interfacial stress transfer in graphene{\textendash}high-density polyethylene (HDPE) nanocomposites. Via detailed characterization of atomic-level stress profiles in submicron graphene fillers, we develop a modified shear-lag model for short fillers. A key feature of our approach lies in the correct accounting of stress concentration at the ends of fillers that exhibits a power-law dependence on filler (``flaw'') size, determined explicitly from atomistic simulations, without any ad hoc modeling assumptions. In addition to two parameters that quantify the end stress concentration, only one additional shear-lag parameter is required to quantify the atomic-level stress profiles in graphene fillers. This three-parameter model is found to be reliable for fillers with dimensions as small as {$\sim$}10 nm. Our model predicts accurately the elastic response of aligned graphene{\textendash}HDPE composites and provides appropriate upper bounds for the elastic moduli of nanocomposites with more realistic randomly distributed and oriented fillers. This study provides a systematic approach for developing hierarchical multiscale models of 2D material-based nanocomposites and is of particular relevance for short fillers, which are, currently, typical of solution-processed 2D materials.},

Parallel processors can be exploited to generate millions of molecular configurations in complex environments at a second, and concomitant free-energy landscapes can be estimated. Databases that are complete in terms of polymer sequences and architecture form a powerful training basis for cross-checking and verifying machine learning-based models. We employ an exhaustive enumeration of polymer sequence space to benchmark the prediction made by a neural network. In our example, we consider the translocation time of a copolymer through a lipid membrane as a function of its sequence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic units. First, we demonstrate that massively parallel Rosenbluth sampling for all possible sequences of a polymer allows for meaningful dynamic interpretation in terms of the mean first escape times through the membrane. Second, we train a multi-layer neural network on logarithmic translocation times and show by the reduction of the training set to a narrow window of translocation times that the neural network develops an internal representation of the physical rules for sequence-controlled diffusion barriers. Based on the narrow training set, the network result approximates the order of magnitude of translocation times in a window that is several orders of magnitude wider than the training window. We investigate how prediction accuracy depends on the distance of unexplored sequences from the training window.},

  abstract = {Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rules consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish.Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences (`polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but prepolish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy.Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last two years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.},

  abstract = {Attention mechanisms play a central role in NLP systems, especially within recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that 'Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

  abstract = {Crystalline porous materials have a variety of uses, such as for catalysis and separation. Identifying suitable materials for a given application can, in principle, be done by screening material databases. Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate structural properties for all materials contained in a database so they can be compared with search queries, grouped or classified. One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efficiently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modified version of the Voro++ library. We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Presently, researchers rely on experience and intuition for choosing or modifying the nanopores to detect a target analyte. The field would greatly benefit from a computational method that could relate the atomic-scale geometry of the nanopores and analytes to the blockade nanopore currents they produce. Existing computational methods are either computationally too expensive to be used routinely in experimental laboratories or not sensitive enough to account for the atomic structure of the pore and the analytes. Here, we demonstrate a robust and inexpensive computational approach{\textemdash}the steric exclusion model (SEM) of nanopore conductance{\textemdash}that is orders of magnitude more efficient than all-atom MD and yet is sensitive enough to account for the atomic structure of the nanopore and the analyte. The method combines the computational efficiency of a finite element solver with the atomic precision of a nanopore conductance map to yield unprecedented speed and accuracy of ionic current prediction. We validate our SEM approach through comparison with the current blockades computed using the all-atom molecular dynamics method for a range of proteins confined to a solid-state nanopore, biological channels embedded in a lipid bilayer membranes, and blockade currents produced by DNA homopolymers in MspA. We illustrate potential applications of SEM by computing blockade currents produced by nucleosome proteins in a solid-state nanopore, individual amino acids in MspA, and by testing the effect of point mutations on amino acid distinguishability. We expect our SEM approach to become an integral part of future development of the nanopore sensing field.},

Signal classification was done in silico to establish performance metrics (i.e., where train and test data were of known type, via single-species data files). It was then performed in solution to assay real mixtures of DNA hairpins. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for denoising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of the DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used as discriminators, and were the focus of off-line training. A multiclass SVM architecture was designed to place less discriminatory load on weaker discriminators, and novel SVM kernels were used to boost discrimination strength. The tuning on HMMs and SVMs enabled biophysical analysis of the captured molecule states and state transitions; structure revealed in the biophysical analysis was used for better feature selection.},

A novel molecular detector is used - one based on current blockade measurements through a nanometer-scale ion channel (alpha-hemolysin). Classification results are described for blockades caused by DNA molecules in the alpha-hemolysin nanopore detector, with signal analysis and pattern recognition performed using a combination of methods from bioinformatics and machine learning. Due to the size of the alpha-hemolysin protein channel, the blockade events report on one DNA molecule at a time, which enables a variety of reproducible, single-molecule biophysical experiments. To capture the full sensitivity of the nanopore detector's blockade signal, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for denoising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of each captured DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that employ novel kernel designs were then used as discriminators. With SVM training performed off-line, and economical HMM processing on-line, blockade classification was possible during capture. HMMs were also used in conjunction with a time-domain finite state automaton (off-line) for feature discovery and kinetics analysis. Analysis of the DNA data indicates a variety of binding (DNA-protein), fraying, and conformational shifts that are consistent with data obtained from thermodynamic analyses (melting curves), X-ray crystallography, and NMR studies. The software tools are designed for analysis of generic blockades in ionic channels, including those in other biological pore-forming toxins, other biological channels in general, and semiconductor-based channels.},

The ITER divertor will be tungsten, which is the primary candidate material for future reactors. Recent experiments involving tungsten exposure to low-energy helium plasmas reveal significant surface modification, including the growth of nanometer-scale tendrils of "fuzz" and formation of nanometer-sized bubbles in the near-surface region. The large span of spatial and temporal scales governing plasma surface interactions are among the challenges to modeling divertor performance. Fortunately, recent innovations in computational modeling, increasingly powerful high-performance computers, and improved experimental characterization tools provide a path toward self-consistent, experimentally validated models of PFC and divertor performance. Recent advances in understanding tungsten-helium interactions are reviewed, including such processes as helium clustering, which serve as nuclei for gas bubbles; and trap mutation, dislocation loop punching and bubble bursting; which together initiate surface morphological modification.},

With them came a paradigm shift in NLP with the starting point for training a model on a downstream task moving from a blank specific model to a general-purpose pretrained architecture. Still, creating these general-purpose models remains an expensive and time-consuming process restricting the use of these methods to a small sub-set of the wider NLP community. In this paper, we present HuggingFace's Transformers library, a library for state-of-the-art NLP, making these developments available to the community by gathering state-of-the-art general-purpose pretrained models under a unified API together with an ecosystem of libraries, examples, tutorials and scripts targeting many downstream NLP tasks. HuggingFace's Transformers library features carefully crafted model implementations and high-performance pretrained weights for two main deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow, while supporting all the necessary tools to analyze, evaluate and use these models in downstream tasks such as text/token classification, questions answering and language generation among others. The library has gained significant organic traction and adoption among both the researcher and practitioner communities. We are committed at HuggingFace to pursue the efforts to develop this toolkit with the ambition of creating the standard library for building NLP systems.},

Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

  abstract = {In the mid-1960s, two English statisticians working at the National Vegetable Research Station invented the Nelder{\textendash}Mead ``simplex '' direct search method. The method emerged at a propitious time, when there was great and growing interest in computer solution of complex nonlinear real-world optimization problems. Because obtaining first derivatives of the function f to be optimized was frequently impossible, the strong preference of most practitioners was for a ``direct search'' method that required only the values of f; the new Nelder{\textendash} Mead method fit the bill perfectly. Since then, the Nelder{\textendash}Mead method has consistently been one of the most used and cited methods for unconstrained optimization. We are fortunate indeed that the late John Nelder 1 has left us a detailed picture of the method's inspiration and development [11, 14]. For Nelder, the starting point was a 1963 conference talk by William Spendley of Imperial Chemical Industries about a ``simplex '' method recently proposed by Spendley, Hext, and Himsworth for response surface exploration [15]. Despite its name, this method is not related to George Dantzig's simplex method for linear programming, which dates from 1947. Nonetheless, the name is entirely appropriate because the Spendley, Hext, and Himsworth method is defined by a simplex; the method constructs a pattern of n + 1 points in dimension n, which moves across the surface to be explored, sometimes changing size, but always retaining the same shape. Inspired by Spendley's talk, Nelder had what he describes as ``one useful new idea'': while defining each iteration via a simplex, add the crucial ingredient that the shape of the simplex should ``adapt itself to the local landscape '' [12]. During a sequence of lively discussions with his colleague Roger Mead, where ``each of us [was] able to try out the ideas of the previous evening on the other the following morning'', they developed a method in which the simplex could ``elongate itself to move down long gentle slopes'', or ``contract itself on to the final minimum '' [11]. And, as they say, the rest is history.},

  abstract = {Transformer is a powerful model for text understanding. However, it is inefficient due to its quadratic complexity to input sequence length. Although there are many methods on Transformer acceleration, they are still either inefficient on long sequences or not effective enough. In this paper, we propose Fastformer, which is an efficient Transformer model based on additive attention. In Fastformer, instead of modeling the pair-wise intractions between tokens, we first use additive attention mechanism to model global contexts, and then further transform each token representation based on its interaction with global context representations. In this way, Fastformer can achieve effective context modeling with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that Fastformer is much more efficient than many existing Transformer models and can meanwhile achieve comparable or even better long text modeling performance.},

  abstract = {Transformer has become ubiquitous in natural language processing (e.g., machine translation, question answering); however, it requires enormous amount of computations to achieve high performance, which makes it not suitable for mobile applications that are tightly constrained by the hardware resources and battery. In this paper, we present an efficient mobile NLP architecture, Lite Transformer to facilitate deploying mobile NLP applications on edge devices. The key primitive is the Long-Short Range Attention (LSRA), where one group of heads specializes in the local context modeling (by convolution) while another group specializes in the long-distance relationship modeling (by attention). Such specialization brings consistent improvement over the vanilla transformer on three well-established language tasks: machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Under constrained resources (500M/100M MACs), Lite Transformer outperforms transformer on WMT'14 English-French by 1.2/1.7 BLEU, respectively. Lite Transformer reduces the computation of transformer base model by 2.5x with 0.3 BLEU score degradation. Combining with pruning and quantization, we further compressed the model size of Lite Transformer by 18.2x. For language modeling, Lite Transformer achieves 1.8 lower perplexity than the transformer at around 500M MACs. Notably, Lite Transformer outperforms the AutoML-based Evolved Transformer by 0.5 higher BLEU for the mobile NLP setting without the costly architecture search that requires more than 250 GPU years.

Using a molecular design algorithm trained to recognize quantitative structure{\textemdash}property relationships with respect to thermal conductivity and other targeted polymeric properties, we identified thousands of promising hypothetical polymers.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.},

It determines the importance of context elements by comparing each element to the current time step. In this paper, we show that a very lightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported self-attention results. Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are simpler and more efficient than self-attention. We predict separate convolution kernels based solely on the current time-step in order to determine the importance of context elements. The number of operations required by this approach scales linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is quadratic. Experiments on large-scale machine translation, language modeling and abstractive summarization show that dynamic convolutions improve over strong self-attention models. On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.},

  abstract = {Vision transformer (ViT) models exhibit substandard optimizability. In particular, they are sensitive to the choice of optimizer (AdamW vs. SGD), optimizer hyperparameters, and training schedule length. In comparison, modern convolutional neural networks are far easier to optimize. Why is this the case? In this work, we conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify stem of ViT models, which is implemented by a stride-p pxp convolution (p=16 by default) applied to the input image. This large-kernel plus large-stride convolution runs counter to typical design choices of convolutional layers in neural networks. To test whether this atypical design choice causes an issue, we analyze the optimization behavior of ViT models with their original patchify stem versus a simple counterpart where we replace the ViT stem by a small number of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions. While the vast majority of computation in the two ViT designs is identical, we find that this small change in early visual processing results in markedly different training behavior in terms of the sensitivity to optimization settings as well as the final model accuracy. Using a convolutional stem in ViT dramatically increases optimization stability and also improves peak performance (by \${\textbackslash}sim\$1-2\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k), while maintaining flops and runtime. The improvement can be observed across the wide spectrum of model complexities (from 1G to 36G flops) and dataset scales (from ImageNet-1k to ImageNet-21k). These findings lead us to recommend using a standard, lightweight convolutional stem for ViT models as a more robust architectural choice compared to the original ViT model design.},

Thus, the early successes in applying SS nanopore devices to the more difficult class of biopolymer, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have been surprising, motivating us to examine the potential use of an SS nanopore to analyze synthetic heparan sulfate GAG chains of controlled composition and sequence prepared through a promising, recently developed chemoenzymatic route. A minimal representation of the nanopore data, using only signal magnitude and duration, revealed, by eye and image recognition algorithms, clear differences between the signals generated by four synthetic GAGs. By subsequent machine learning, it was possible to determine disaccharide and even monosaccharide composition of these four synthetic GAGs using as few as 500 events, corresponding to a zeptomole of sample. These data suggest that ultrasensitive GAG analysis may be possible using SS nanopore detection and well-characterized molecular training sets.},

In this work we show how material descriptors can be learned from the structures present in large scale datasets of material simulations; and how these descriptors can be used to improve the prediction of an experimental property, the energy of formation of a solid. The material descriptors are learned by training a Graph Neural Network to regress simulated formation energies from a material's atomistic structure. Using these learned features for experimental property predictions outperforms existing methods that are based solely on chemical composition. Moreover, we find that the advantage of our approach increases as the generalization requirements of the task are made more stringent, for example when limiting the amount of training data or when generalizing to unseen chemical spaces.},

The self-consistent equations resulting from this formalism are invariant to sequence complexity. Its computational cost is shown to be a factor Ns (number of points used to discretize the polymer contour length) more expensive than the current SCFT formalism. A variety of copolymers of varying complexity are simulated with the new sequence SCFT formalism and are shown to match literature results. Additionally, sequence SCFT is shown to enable a method of investigating the configurational distribution of polymer chains which make up a phase-separated structure. The ease at which this new formalism handles complex polymer sequences will enable new discoveries of design rules governing sequence-controlled polymer properties.},

  abstract = {It is commonly believed that networks cannot be both accurate and robust, that gaining robustness means losing accuracy. It is also generally believed that, unless making networks larger, network architectural elements would otherwise matter little in improving adversarial robustness. Here we present evidence to challenge these common beliefs by a careful study about adversarial training. Our key observation is that the widely-used ReLU activation function significantly weakens adversarial training due to its non-smooth nature. Hence we propose smooth adversarial training (SAT), in which we replace ReLU with its smooth approximations to strengthen adversarial training. The purpose of smooth activation functions in SAT is to allow it to find harder adversarial examples and compute better gradient updates during adversarial training. Compared to standard adversarial training, SAT improves adversarial robustness for "free", i.e., no drop in accuracy and no increase in computational cost. For example, without introducing additional computations, SAT significantly enhances ResNet-50's robustness from 33.0\% to 42.3\%, while also improving accuracy by 0.9\% on ImageNet. SAT also works well with larger networks: it helps EfficientNet-L1 to achieve 82.2\% accuracy and 58.6\% robustness on ImageNet, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art defense by 9.5\% for accuracy and 11.6\% for robustness.},

The proposed approach consists of two main problems: 1) the learning of an approximation to the effective Hamiltonian as a function of the average monomer density fields and the relevant physical parameters and 2) the prediction of saddle density fields given the polymer parameters. There is an additional challenge: the effective Hamiltonian has to be invariant under shifts (and rotations in 2D and 3D). A data-enhancing approach and an appropriate regularization are introduced to effectively achieve said invariance. In this first study, the focus is on one-dimensional (in physical space) systems to allow for a thorough exploration and development of the proposed methodology.},

A novel machine learning method is developed to solve the general FP equations based on deep neural networks.

The main novelty of this paper is that penalty factors are introduced to overcome the local optimization for the deep learning approach, and the corresponding setting rules are given. Meanwhile, we consider a normalization condition as a supervision condition to effectively avoid that the trial solution is zero. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate performances of the proposed algorithm, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems. All the results suggest that the deep learning is quite feasible and effective to calculate the FP equation. Furthermore, influences of the number of hidden layers, the penalty factors, and the optimization algorithm are discussed in detail.

  abstract = {There is a growing demand for the use of machine learning (ML) to derive fast-to-evaluate surrogate models of materials properties. In recent years, a broad array of materials property databases have emerged as part of a digital transformation of materials science. However, recent technological advances in ML are not fully exploited because of the insufficient volume and diversity of materials data. An ML framework called ``transfer learning'' has considerable potential to overcome the problem of limited amounts of materials data. Transfer learning relies on the concept that various property types, such as physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties, are physically interrelated. For a given target property to be predicted from a limited supply of training data, models of related proxy properties are pretrained using sufficient data; these models capture common features relevant to the target task. Repurposing of such machine-acquired features on the target task yields outstanding prediction performance even with exceedingly small data sets, as if highly experienced human experts can make rational inferences even for considerably less experienced tasks. In this study, to facilitate widespread use of transfer learning, we develop a pretrained model library called XenonPy.MDL. In this first release, the library comprises more than 140\,000 pretrained models for various properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic crystalline materials. Along with these pretrained models, we describe some outstanding successes of transfer learning in different scenarios such as building models with only dozens of materials data, increasing the ability of extrapolative prediction through a strategic model transfer, and so on. Remarkably, transfer learning has autonomously identified rather nontrivial transferability across different properties transcending the different disciplines of materials science; for example, our analysis has revealed underlying bridges between small molecules and polymers and between organic and inorganic chemistry.},

  abstract = {Advancements in neural machinery have led to a wide range of algorithmic solutions for molecular property prediction. Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial data sets spanning a wide variety of chemical end points. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary data sets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.},

Machine-learning approaches predict how sequence maps to function in a data-driven manner without requiring a detailed model of the underlying physics or biological pathways.

Here we introduce the steps required to build machine-learning sequence{\textendash}function models and to use those models to guide engineering, making recommendations at each stage. This review covers basic concepts relevant to the use of machine learning for protein engineering, as well as the current literature and applications of this engineering paradigm.

  abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in aqueous media is very important for its implications in several fields of science, from biology to industrial processes. Modelling these reactions is however difficult when water directly participates in the reaction. Since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system, \$\emph{ab-initio}\$ molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state configurations. In this study, we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover a number of novel metastable states and to improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the pH solution.},

Many of them have high internal surface areas and other desirable properties for gas storage, separation, and other applications. The notable variety of the possible building blocks and the diverse ways they can be assembled endow reticular frameworks with a near-infinite combinatorial design space, making reticular chemistry both promising and challenging for prospective materials design. Here, we propose an automated nanoporous materials discovery platform powered by a supramolecular variational autoencoder (SmVAE) for the generative design of reticular materials with desired functions. We demonstrate the automated design process with a class of metal-organic framework (MOF) structures and the goal of separating CO2 from natural gas or flue gas. Our model exhibits high fidelity in capturing structural features and reconstructing MOF structures. We show that the autoencoder has a promising optimization capability when jointly trained with multiple top adsorbent candidates identified for superior gas separation. MOFs discovered here are strongly competitive against some of the best-performing MOFs/zeolites ever reported. This platform lays the groundwork for the design of reticular frameworks for desired applications.},

These ML-based nanopore callers have typically been trained on data that span all modifications on all possible DNA k-mer backgrounds{\textemdash}a complete training dataset. However, as nanopore technology is pushed to more and more epigenetic modifications, such complete training data will not be feasible to obtain. Nanopore calling has historically been performed with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that cannot make successful calls for k-mer contexts not seen during training because of their independent emission distributions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs), which share parameters across contexts, are increasingly being used as callers, often outperforming their HMM cousins. It stands to reason that a DNN approach should be able to better generalize to unseen k-mer contexts. Indeed, herein we demonstrate that a common DNN approach (DeepSignal) outperforms a common HMM approach (Nanopolish) in the incomplete data setting. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid HMM-DNN approach, Amortized-HMM, that outperforms both the pure HMM and DNN approaches on 5mC calling when the training data are incomplete. Such an approach is expected to be useful for calling 5hmC and combinations of cytosine modifications, where complete training data are not likely to be available.},

To determine nucleotides from measured signals, a translation process known as basecalling is required. However, compared to NGS basecallers, the calling accuracy of MinION still needs to be improved.In this work, a simple but powerful neural network architecture called multi-scale recurrent caller (MSRCall) is proposed. MSRCall comprises a multi-scale structure, recurrent layers, a fusion block and a connectionist temporal classification decoder. To better identify both short-and long-range dependencies, the recurrent layer is redesigned to capture various time-scale features with a multi-scale structure.

Simulation results for the density profiles and configurational properties are presented for wall separations varying from 4 to 16 hard sphere diameters and for volume fractions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. It is found that the chains are depleted at the wall at the lower density but enhanced at the wall (relative to the center of the pore) at the higher density. The density of end sites of the chain at the wall is higher than it is for middle sites. Near the wall the chains are found to be flattened against the wall; in the large pore the fluid in the middle of the pore is uniform. In the bulk region, the distribution of sites about the center of mass is Gaussian; near the wall it is asymmetric and sharply peaked. In the smallest pore the chains are almost two dimensional. The force on the walls as a function of wall separation is calculated by using a superposition approximation to obtain the density profile for a fluid in small pores from the density profile for a fluid in a large pore at the same chemical potential. At high densities the force is an oscillatory function of wall separation with a period of oscillation of about one bead diameter, but at low densities it is monotonic and attractive. {\textcopyright} 1990, American Chemical Society.

  abstract = {Permanently crosslinked polyelectrolyte gels are known to undergo discontinuous first-order volume phase transitions, the onset of which may be caused by a number of factors. In this study we examine the volumetric properties of such polyelectrolyte gels in relation to the progressive substitution of monovalent counterions by divalent counterions as the gels are equilibrated in solvents of different dielectric qualities. We compare the results of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of polyelectrolyte gels with previous experimental measurements by others on polyacrylate gels. The simulations show that under equilibrium conditions there is an approximate cancellation between the electrostatic contribution and the counterion excluded-volume contribution to the osmotic pressure in the gel-solvent system; these two contributions to the osmotic pressure have, respectively, energetic and entropic origins. The finding of such a cancellation between the two contributions to the osmotic pressure of the gel-solvent system is consistent with experimental observations that the swelling behavior of polyelectrolyte gels can be described by equations of state for neutral gels. Based on these results, we show and explain that a modified form of the Flory{\textendash}Huggins model for nonionic polymer solutions, which accounts for neither electrostatic effects nor counterion excluded-volume effects, fits both experimental and simulated data for polyelectrolyte gels. The Flory{\textendash}Huggins interaction parameters obtained from regression to the simulation data are characteristic of ideal polymer solutions, whereas the experimentally obtained interaction parameters, particularly that associated with the third virial coefficient, exhibit a significant departure from ideality, leading us to conclude that further enhancements to the simulation model, such as the inclusion of excess salt, the allowance for size asymmetric electrolytes, or the use of a distance-dependent solvent dielectricity model, may be required. Molecular simulations also reveal that the condensation of divalent counterions onto the polyelectrolyte network backbone occurs preferentially over that of monovalent counterions.},

  abstract = {Langevin field-theoretic simulation (L-FTS) is a promising tool in polymer field theory that can account for the compositional fluctuation effect, which is neglected in the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). However, L-FTS is a computationally expensive tool, and it may take more than a week to accurately calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic quantities. In our previous study, we introduced a deep neural network (DNN) that estimates the saddle point of the pressure field to reduce the subsequent Anderson mixing (AM) iterations. Herein, we propose a novel DNN that can be successively applied to determine the saddle point without using conventional field-update algorithms. Major deep learning (DL) models for semantic segmentation in computer vision are adopted to construct the optimal DNN architecture. Our model utilizing atrous convolutions in parallel is accurate and computationally efficient, and it is robust to the simulation parameter changes and can consequently be reused after single training. We demonstrate that our DNN can achieve speedup of factor 6 or more compared to the AM method without affecting accuracy. Open-source code for our deep Langevin FTS (DL-FTS) enables an easy and rapid Python scripting of SCFT and L-FTS incorporated with CPU or GPU parallelization and DL.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between neurons. However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a sweet spot of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural networks performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.},

This review places the focus on specific ion effects, multivalent ion effects, and ionic hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity effects in synthetic polymer systems from solutions to brushes and gels. The specific ion effects on neutral polymers are determined by both the direct and indirect specific ion{\textendash}polymer interactions, whereas the ion specificities of charged polymers are mainly dominated by the specific ion-pairing interactions. The ionic cross-linking effect exerted by the multivalent ions is widely used to tune the properties of polyelectrolytes, while the reentrant behavior of polyelectrolytes in the presence of multivalent ions still remains poorly understood. The ionic hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity effects not only can be applied to make strong polyelectrolytes thermosensitive, but also can be used to prepare polymeric nano-objects and to control the wettability of polyelectrolyte brush-modified surfaces. The not well-studied ionic hydrogen bond effects are also discussed in the last section of this review.},

  abstract = {Advances in synthetic chemistry have led to greater control over the sequence of polymeric materials, and the ability to create patterns whose complexity is reminiscent of that of biological macromolecules. In random copolymers synthesized via statistical copolymerization, the sequence follows a first-order Markov chain process governed by the underlying reactivity ratios. In this work, theory and simulations are combined to study the role of sequence in the complex coacervation of oppositely charged random (co)polyelectrolytes, i.e. copolymers comprising cationic/anionic and neutral monomers. It is found that charged monomers enhance the proclivity towards complex coacervation, and enhance the coacervates' stability upon addition of salt. This result is general, and holds for both good and poor solvents, despite the different (``closed'' and ``open'') shapes of the respective coacervation binodals. For high charge blockiness, simulations reveal the formation of microphase separated coacervates consisting of domains rich in ionic or neutral monomers. The transition from homogeneous to locally segregated coacervates leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the density on charge blockiness. Our results provide a comprehensive framework to understand and interpret the effects of sequence on complex coacervation, and for rational design of coacervate-based materials.},

  abstract = {Recent deep learning based approaches have shown promising results for the challenging task of inpainting large missing regions in an image. These methods can generate visually plausible image structures and textures, but often create distorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas. This is mainly due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in explicitly borrowing or copying information from distant spatial locations. On the other hand, traditional texture and patch synthesis approaches are particularly suitable when it needs to borrow textures from the surrounding regions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new deep generative model-based approach which can not only synthesize novel image structures but also explicitly utilize surrounding image features as references during network training to make better predictions. The model is a feedforward, fully convolutional neural network which can process images with multiple holes at arbitrary locations and with variable sizes during the test time. Experiments on multiple datasets including faces (CelebA, CelebA-HQ), textures (DTD) and natural images (ImageNet, Places2) demonstrate that our proposed approach generates higher-quality inpainting results than existing ones.

  abstract = {Recent interest in complex coacervation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) has been fueled by its relevance to biology in the context of membraneless organelle formation within living cells. For PEs with limited flexibility (such as double-stranded DNA), theoretical treatments and recent experiments have reported the emergence of liquid crystalline order (LCO) within the resulting coacervate phases. In this work, we study the underlying physics of this phenomenon using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of symmetric semiflexible{\textendash}semiflexible and asymmetric semiflexible{\textendash}flexible coacervates. By comparing coacervates with the corresponding semidilute solutions of neutral polymers, we demonstrate that the presence of Coulomb interactions in coacervates facilitates orientational ordering, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Quantitative comparisons between our simulations and theory indicate that, for asymmetric nematic coacervates, the strong orientational ordering of stiff polyanions induces a weak ordering of the flexible polycations-an effect that was not anticipated by available theoretical studies. Simulations reveal that, for nematic coacervates, the preferred orientation of the PE chains at the liquid{\textendash}liquid coacervate{\textendash}supernatant interface is parallel, and the alignment of semiflexible PEs is homogeneous. The results presented here provide new molecular-level insights into the intra-coacervate LCO and will help motivate further experimental and theoretical activities in this area.},

Here we show that the zeptolitre sensing volume of bilayer-coated solid-state nanopores can be used to determine the approximate shape, volume, charge, rotational diffusion coefficient and dipole moment of individual proteins. To do this, we developed a theory for the quantitative understanding of modulations in ionic current that arise from the rotational dynamics of single proteins as they move through the electric field inside the nanopore. The approach allows us to measure the five parameters simultaneously, and we show that they can be used to identify, characterize and quantify proteins and protein complexes with potential implications for structural biology, proteomics, biomarker detection and routine protein analysis.},

However, threading of full-length proteins has only been achieved using enzymatic unfolding and translocation. Here we describe an enzyme-free approach for unidirectional, slow transport of full-length proteins through nanopores. We show that the combination of a chemically resistant biological nanopore, {$\alpha$}-hemolysin (narrowest part is {\textasciitilde}1.4\,nm in diameter), and a high concentration guanidinium chloride buffer enables unidirectional, single-file protein transport propelled by an electroosmotic effect. We show that the mean protein translocation velocity depends linearly on the applied voltage and translocation times depend linearly on length, resembling the translocation dynamics of ssDNA. Using a supervised machine-learning classifier, we demonstrate that single-translocation events contain sufficient information to distinguish their threading orientation and identity with accuracies larger than 90\%. Capture rates of protein are increased substantially when either a genetically encoded charged peptide tail or a DNA tag is added to a protein.},

  abstract = {Molecules are complex dynamic objects that can exist in different molecular forms (conformations, tautomers, stereoisomers, protonation states, etc.) and often it is not known which molecular form is responsible for observed physicochemical and biological properties of a given molecule. This raises the problem of the selection of the correct molecular form for machine learning modeling of target properties. The same problem is common to biological molecules (RNA, DNA, proteins){\textemdash}long sequences where only key segments, which often cannot be located precisely, are involved in biological functions. Multi-instance machine learning (MIL) is an efficient approach for solving problems where objects under study cannot be uniquely represented by a single instance, but rather by a set of multiple alternative instances. Multi-instance learning was formalized in 1997 and motivated by the problem of conformation selection in drug activity prediction tasks. Since then MIL has found a lot of applications in various domains, such as information retrieval, computer vision, signal processing, bankruptcy prediction, and so on. In the given review we describe the MIL framework and its applications to the tasks associated with ambiguity in the representation of small and biological molecules in chemoinformatics and bioinformatics. We have collected examples that demonstrate the advantages of MIL over the traditional single-instance learning (SIL) approach. Special attention was paid to the ability of MIL models to identify key instances responsible for a modeling property.

  abstract = {Nanopore sequencing is promising because of its long read length and high speed. During sequencing, a strand of DNA/RNA passes through a biological nanopore, which causes the current in the pore to fluctuate. During basecalling, context-dependent current measurements are translated into the base sequence of the DNA/RNA strand. Accurate and fast basecalling is vital for downstream analyses such as genome assembly and detecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants. However, owing to the various changes in DNA/RNA molecules, noise during sequencing, and limitations of basecalling methods, accurate basecalling remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Causalcall, which uses an end-to-end temporal convolution-based deep learning model for accurate and fast nanopore basecalling. Developed on a temporal convolutional network (TCN) and a connectionist temporal classification decoder, Causalcall directly identifies base sequences of varying lengths from current measurements in long time series. In contrast to the basecalling models using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the convolution-based model of Causalcall can speed up basecalling by matrix computation. Experiments on multiple species have demonstrated the great potential of the TCN-based model to improve basecalling accuracy and speed when compared to an RNN-based model. Besides, experiments on genome assembly indicate the utility of Causalcall in reference-based genome assembly.},

  abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification, which is widely associated with various biological processes, such as gene expression, aging, and disease. Nanopore sequencing provides a promising methylation detection approach through monitoring abnormal signal shifts for detecting modified bases in target motif regions. Recently, model-based approaches, especially those with deep learning models, have achieved significant performance improvements on nanopore methylation detection. In this work, we explore using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for doing the task, which can provide non-recurrent neural structures for fast parallel computation. Results: We find original BERT architecture does not work as well as the bidirectional recurrent neural network (biRNN) on the nanopore methylation prediction task. Through further analysis, we observe recurrent patterns of positional-signal-shift in the context window surrounding target 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and N6-methyladenine (6mA) motifs. We propose a refined BERT with relative position representation and center hidden units concatenation, which takes account of task-specific characters into modeling. We perform systematic evaluations in-sample and cross-sample. The experiment results show that the refined BERT model can achieve competitive or even better results than the state-of-the-art biRNN model, while the model inference speed is about 6x faster. Besides, on the cross-sample evaluation of datasets from the different research groups, BERT models demonstrate a good generalization performance.},

  abstract = {Polyampholytes are polymers with both cationic and anionic monomers that have many features in common with proteins. These molecules have many applications associated with their natural biocompatibility and their propensity to form viscoelastic fluids and gels due to their common tendency to form self-assembled structures in solution. Recently, advances in the synthesis capabilities have enabled the fine-tuning of the monomer structure and composition, such as the sequence and ratio of the charged and hydrophobic groups. We correspondingly investigate these molecular characteristics on the solution properties of a series of poly(carbonate)-based polyampholytes using both molecular dynamics simulations and small-angle neutron scattering measurements. Our simulations suggest the importance of hydrophobic groups for understanding the observed properties of our polyampholyte solutions, a well-known fact for protein solutions. In particular, our simulations indicate that the hydrophobic groups cause the polyampholyte chains to form compact micelle-like rather than diffuse clusters at low concentrations and greatly influence the concentration dependence of the correlation peak in the structure factor describing the correlation distance between the polyampholyte chains in solution. We also construct a polyampholyte solution association map where the polymer concentration and charge ratios lead to different propensities of association (or clustering) and determine a self-assembly boundary governing the transition between self-assembled clusters that resemble micelles and a transient polymer network that percolates the system.},

First, to identify the optimal condition for machine learning prediction, the effects of training set preparation method, training set size, and machine learning models were investigated. Our analysis showed that kernel ridge regression provides the highest prediction accuracy, and randomly selected 5\% structures of the entire set would work well as a training set. Our results showed that both descriptors accurately predicted performance and even structural properties of zeolites. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our approach predicts accurately properties of metal-organic frameworks, which might indicate the possibility of this approach to be easily applied to predict the properties of other types of nanoporous materials.},

Through detecting the change of ion currency signals during a DNA/RNA fragment's pass through a nanopore, genotypes are determined. Currently, the accuracy of nanopore basecalling has a higher error rate than the basecalling of short-read sequencing. Through utilizing deep neural networks, the-state-of-the art nanopore basecallers achieve basecalling accuracy in a range from 85\% to 95\%. Result: In this work, we proposed a novel basecalling approach from a perspective of instance segmentation. Different from previous approaches of doing typical sequence labeling, we formulated the basecalling problem as a multi-label segmentation task. Meanwhile, we proposed a refined U-net model which we call UR-net that can model sequential dependencies for a one-dimensional segmentation task. The experiment results show that the proposed basecaller URnano achieves competitive results on the in-species data, compared to the recently proposed CTC-featured basecallers. Conclusion: Our results show that formulating the basecalling problem as a one-dimensional segmentation task is a promising approach, which does basecalling and segmentation jointly.},

Chromatin accessibility changes not only directly affect drug{\textendash}DNA interactions, but they can promote or inhibit the expression of the critical genes associated with drug resistance by affecting the DNA binding capacity of TFs and transcriptional regulators. However, the biological experimental techniques for measuring it are expensive and time-consuming. In recent years, several kinds of computational methods have been proposed to identify accessible regions of the genome. Existing computational models mostly ignore the contextual information provided by the bases in gene sequences. To address these issues, we proposed a new solution called SemanticCAP. It introduces a gene language model that models the context of gene sequences and is thus able to provide an effective representation of a certain site in a gene sequence. Basically, we merged the features provided by the gene language model into our chromatin accessibility model. During the process, we designed methods called SFA and SFC to make feature fusion smoother. Compared to DeepSEA, gkm-SVM, and k-mer using public benchmarks, our model proved to have better performance, showing a 1.25\% maximum improvement in auROC and a 2.41\% maximum improvement in auPRC.},

By combining the cluster theory in dilute solution with our recently developed mean-field theory for inhomogeneous polyelectrolyte solutions (Zhang, P.; Wang, Z.-G. Macromolecules 2021, 54, 10994), we systematically investigate the structure of finite-sized clusters formed by oppositely charged polyions in symmetric dilute solutions and how these clusters affect the binodal, spinodal, and nucleation for polyelectrolyte complex coacervation. We find that both the polyion concentration deep inside the cluster and the interfacial tension decrease with increasing the cluster size, reaching their respective bulk coexistence values with corrections inversely proportional to the cluster radius. The polyion concentration in the supernatant phase at coexistence is several orders of magnitude higher than that obtained under the uniform mixing approximation. For most relevant conditions away from the critical point, the supernatant phase consists predominantly of polyion pairs. By examining the nucleation barrier in supersaturated solutions, we can determine a pseudo-spinodal when the barrier is a few multiples of the thermal energy. The location of this pseudo-spinodal is similarly shifted to much higher concentrations than predicted under the uniform mixing approximation. Making the volume approximation for the clusters, we obtain simple analytical expressions for the cluster formation free energy, the modified binodal, and the pseudo-spinodal. In particular, we propose a simple approximate formula for estimating the concentration of the coexisting supernatant phase in terms of the chain length, interfacial tension, and the polyion concentration in the coacervate phase.},

Self-assembly in this system arises from the competing roles of {$\pi$}{\textendash}{$\pi$} stacking from donor{\textendash}acceptor units and hydrogen bonding among the intervening urethane spacers. Using dynamic light scattering and varying temperatures and concentrations of the polymer in DMF solutions, we find the coexistence of two populations of self-assembly and an unconventional enhanced ordering inside the self-assembled structures at higher temperatures. Our system exhibits the opposite phenomenon of protein denaturation and disorder{\textendash}order transitions in conventional polymeric systems: both populations of self-assembled structures become more ordered and compact when heated. In addition, these self-assembled structures show a temperature-dependent memory effect. The pathways of temperature dependence of the size of the assembled structures are different between the heating and cooling steps, exhibiting a strong memory effect. These unusual phenomena emerge from the inherent nature of the free energy landscapes associated with the organization of structures in systems with competing energetic and entropic forces, leading to nonequilibrium properties such as memory effects. This work provides new insights into the physical mechanism of entropically regulated hierarchical macromolecule self-assembly with competing interactions encoded in their chemical sequences, with a great potential to formulate a fundamental understanding for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases that emerge from ill ordering of macromolecules.},

  abstract = {{\textemdash}Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f (x) = x {$\cdot$} sigmoid({$\beta$}x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},
